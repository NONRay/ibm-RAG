        "text": "# A N N U A L   R E P O R T 4\n\n\n# Chairman's Message\n\n2022 was dominated by major events that impacted economies and financial markets around the world: the outbreak of war in Ukraine in of raw materials and energy supplies, and rapid interest rate hikes by\n\nFebruary, surging inflation in the industrialised countries with shortages central banks which signalled the abrupt shift in monetary policy. The question of whether inflation was transitory or not was soon settled. The most significant development of the year turned out to be the emergence of general and sustained price increases which prompted a tightening of monetary policy worldwide. This brought an end to an exceptional period of negative interest rates and also halted the postCovid recovery phase. The slowdown in the Chinese economy and the recessionary effects of inflation were beginning to be felt. U.S. GDP grew at an annualised rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Household consumption remained buoyant, driven mostly by a rapid depletion of savings and a sustained rise in consumer credit. The Fed and the ECB embarked on an aggressive round of interest\n\nrate hikes in 2022 and will decide on subsequent monetary policy developments in 2023.\n\nThis political and economic environment drove higher levels of activity in the financial markets from the second half of the year.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Group's adjusted consolidated revenue for the full year was up 10.6% at constant exchange rates to CHF 1,028.6m, compared with CHF 950.8m in 2021. After an increase of 7.7% at constant exchange rates in the first half, consolidated adjusted revenue was up 13.8% at constant exchange rates in the second half compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nAdjusted underlying operating profit was CHF 130.3m against CHF 99.9m in 2021, an increase of 34.0% at constant exchange rates, with an operating margin of 12.7% and 10.5% respectively.\n\nConsolidated net profit was CHF 97.4m compared with CHF 71.5m in 2021 with a Group share of\n\nCHF 89.1m against CHF 65.3m in 2021, an increase of 40.3% at constant exchange rates.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 May 2023, the Board will be seeking shareholder approval to pay a cash dividend of CHF 5.50 per share. In addition, an exceptional distribution of treasury shares will also be proposed, with one share to be distributed for every 100 shares held. I would like to thank all the Group's employees for their hard work and commitment throughout the year, and our shareholders for their continued loyalty and trust.\n\nPatrick Combes"

We match transactions between buyers and sellers in a wide variety of cash and derivatives, over-the counter (OTC), CCP-cleared and exchangetraded financial instruments, both in global and local markets. By providing transparency without detriment to liquidity, we help our clients source prices and counterparties.\n\nOur clients have access to a global network, in-depth market intelligence, specialised knowledge of local markets and products, and large pools of liquidity. They benefit from the anonymity that reduces the market impact of placing orders. For this, brokers are organised in around 300 different desks, each representing a centre of expertise in a given market segment. Operating on the basis of a pure agency model with no conflict of interest and no position taking, our revenues primarily consist of commissions earned by matching trades, and only if a trade is matched.\n\nThis very competitive business model based on high volume and low commission rates, compared to that of an exchange for example, implies that we keep a continuous focus on excelling in serving our client base. This translates into the best possible service and the tightest market prices for them.\n\nThis is also a highly scalable business model with a strong operating leverage when market volumes surge.\n\nSince 2011, we have proactively developed global trading solutions with clients and, wherever possible, such as for Trad-X, an electronic\n\n\n## Tradition, a Global Platform\n\ntrading platform for interest rate swaps, in partnership with them. In December 2022, we have announced the acquisition of MTS Markets International Inc. which operates BondsPro, an electronic credit trading platform. Our objective is to continue to extend our positioning and capabilities in electronic broking and to deliver efficiency and excellence in hybrid execution and high-touch broker services thanks to continuing investment in proprietary technology. All of our activities operate within an extensively regulated framework.\n\n\n## TRADITIONDATA, FROM ANCILLARY TO CORE\n\nThere is a growing demand for financial market information fuelled by the combination of regulatory requirements and data analytics advancements. This has led us to develop TraditionData, a division dedicated to data commercialisation either directly or through data vendors. TraditionData has its own product specialists and universe of clients. Initially viewed as an ancillary business, it is becoming core with significant growth opportunities. First, clients are looking for independent sources of reliable price and volume information for OTC markets, and the addressable market is expanding for realtime, end of day, historical data sets and also analytics. Tradition and its peers are also lagging behind the exchanges in terms of ability to monetise their data assets. Finally, TraditionData is still small in terms of percentage of total revenues compared to the benchmark in our industry.\n\nThis is a business with recurring revenues and a high level of margin."

They submit a detailed report on the auditing process, important matters relating to the application of accounting standards and reporting, and the results of the examination of the compliance system.\n\nMinutes of the Audit Committee meetings are forwarded to the Board of Directors. The Committee held four meetings in 2022, which lasted an average of three and a half hours. The Group Chief Financial Officer chairs three Regional Audit Committees which also include the Group Chief Legal Officer and the head of compliance and operational risks. The EMEA Regional Audit Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Legal Officer ad interim; the Group Chief Financial Officer is also a member of the Committee.\n\nThe role of these Regional Audit Committees is to review the effectiveness of the internal\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\ncontrol environment in the Group entities, particularly with regard to the closing of the annual and half-yearly accounts. The Regional Audit Committees submit periodic reports to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is chaired by Robert Pennone and comprises two members - Robert Pennone and Christian Goecking, both independent and non-executive members. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding remuneration schemes and policies and, more specifically, the remuneration of Executive Board members, share option schemes and other incentive schemes. It met once in 2022 for a one-and-ahalf-hour meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Publicly Listed Companies (ORAb/VegüV), the members of the Remuneration Committee are individually elected each year by the General Meeting.\n\nBoard Committees have an advisory role and have no decision-making powers. Their responsibility is to make recommendations to the Board of Directors, which then takes decisions.\n\nThe Group Chief Legal Officer, William Wostyn, is Secretary to the Board of Directors and its committees. In accordance with Article 24 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors appoints a secretary, who may be chosen from outside the Board.\n\nIn carrying out its work, the Board of Directors and its committees receive the full support of the Executive Board, which attends meetings when invited. At these meetings the Executive Board briefs the directors on its management, business operations, the most significant developments concerning the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Depending on the agenda set by the Chair of each of the Committees, one or more Executive Board members or department heads are invited to attend the meetings, to provide information required by the Committee members and answer questions. However, no Executive Board members attend the Remuneration Committee. Moreover, a Management Information System (MIS), at the holding company level, under the responsibility of the Group Chief Financial Officer, allows regular and frequent monitoring\n\n\n## 21\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

This monitoring is carried out on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the criteria, and includes all Group subsidiaries. It entails comparison with the previous year's results and, more particularly, with the current year's budgets and targets.\n\nIn addition, risk management and internal audit operations have been set up, which are described in more detail on page 27.\n\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of the regional managers of Tradition Group's operating entities (Americas, EMEA, Asia-Pacific), who are directly employed by the regional entities, as well as the Group Finance Director and the Strategic Marketing Director. They meet periodically as an Executive Committee, and exercise the powers conferred on them by the Rules of Procedure https://tradition.com/about-us/board-of-\n\ndirectors.aspx (French only).\n\nThe Board of Directors delegates all day-to-day management of the Company to the Executive Board. Each regional manager manages the Group's subsidiaries under their responsibility, applying the strategy and budget established by the Board of Directors, having regard to any restrictions on their delegation of powers. All Executive Board members report regularly to the Chair of the Board of Directors on the day-to-day management of the Company, and provide him with timely information on all events and significant changes within the Group. This Committee is joined by the Group Chief Legal Officer (Secretary to the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee). The Board of Directors' strategy, as well as its development priorities and the action required to comply with its guidelines are communicated through the Executive Committee. It prepares the annual budget, which is then presented to the Board of Directors for approval, and ensures that it is complied with and monitored as part of the regional operations management. Biographical details of each of the Executive Committee members, including their education, career history, and positions within Compagnie Financière Tradition SA are disclosed on pages 33 and 34.\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nMembers of the Executive Board do not hold any other positions in governing or supervisory bodies of major Swiss or foreign, private or public corporations, foundations or institutions. They do not exercise any management or advisory functions on behalf of major Swiss or foreign interest groups, and do not hold any official position or political office.\n\nThere were no management contracts between Compagnie Financière Tradition SA and any companies or persons outside the Group at 31 December 2022.\n\n\n## SHAREHOLDINGS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS\n\nPursuant to Article 663c(3) CO, shareholdings in the Company, conversion rights and share options held by Directors and Executive Board members and others in a close relationship with them at 31 December 2022 are disclosed from page 140 to 142.\n\n\n## REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS\n\nPursuant to Articles 13 et seq. ORAb/VegüV, compensation paid, as well as guarantees, loans, advances or credit granted by Compagnie Financière Tradition SA or any of its subsidiaries, to Directors, Executive Board members, and others in a close relationship with them, are disclosed in the remuneration report from page 148 to 150.\n\n\nUnder Article 30bis of the Articles of Association, Directors and Executive Board members may serve on governing or administrative bodies of legal entities required to be registered with the Swiss Commercial Registry, or with a similar registry abroad, and which are not controlled by the Company or do not control the Company, subject to the following conditions:\n- in Swiss or foreign companies whose shares -are listed on the stock exchange: no more than five appointments;\n- in Swiss or foreign companies whose shares -are not listed on the stock exchange: no more than fifteen appointments;\n- in other entities with an essentially nor-for--profit object: no more than ten appointments."

The Remuneration\n\nThey are presently defined in the form of directors' fees. The annual compensation for each director comprises a fixed fee of CHF 20,000, with the exception of the Chair who does not receive remuneration, and a variable fee of up to CHF 10,000 related to attendance at Board meetings during the year. Each Director serving on the Audit Committee receives additional annual compensation of CHF 20,000. Each Director serving on the Remuneration Committee receives additional annual compensation of CHF 10,000.\n\nThe maximum total remuneration for the Board of Directors is now approved by the General Meeting each year for the following calendar year.\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors defines the terms of remuneration for Executive Board members after consultation with the Remuneration Committee. Given the specific nature of the activities, the very limited number of comparable companies in this sector, and the quality and relevance of the information\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\navailable, the use of 'comparatives' is not appropriate.\n\nRemuneration is set on the basis of direct negotiations with the executives concerned, the relative scale and weight of the activities they supervise, their ability to implement the Group's strategy taking into account both business development and profitability requirements, and the remuneration practices of leading competitors in the business sector in which the Company operates, insofar as they are known. These remuneration terms are then submitted to the General Meeting for approval. For operational members, they include a fixed salary as well as a performance-related payment linked to the operating performance of the subsidiaries they manage (without weighting relative to other objectives), or a discretionary bonus with a minimum guarantee where appropriate. Functional members receive a fixed salary and a discretionary bonus. The discretionary bonuses are set by the Chair of the Board of Directors, and may be quarterly or annual depending on the case. The Chair and Executive Board members do not take part in the deliberations of the Remuneration Committee, which determines the amount of remuneration.\n\nAs a guide, in 2022, the variable part represented between 0% and 57% of total compensation. It consisted of a percentage of the operating profit of entities under the responsibility of the operational members of the relevant Executive Board.\n\nThese compensation components are paid in cash. The Remuneration Committee briefs the Board of Directors at least once a year on Executive Board compensation.\n\nAs part of our compensation structure, options may be awarded to Directors or Executive Board members on a discretionary basis with the aim of encouraging their contribution to the Company's growth over the long-term. Such awards have no fixed frequency and are decided by the Board of Directors after consultation with the Remuneration Committee.\n\nNo share options were awarded to Directors in 2022, while a total of 80,000 options was awarded to Executive Board members. The status of existing options is set out on pages 100 and 101. Further information will be provided in the annual report if and when new options are awarded.\n\n\n## 23\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

No Directors or Executive Board members received additional fees from Compagnie Financière Tradition SA in 2022, except for any services provided under a service contract. Pursuant to the ORAb/VegüV, the General Meeting approves total remuneration in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association.\n\nAs the General Meeting approves the remuneration of Executive Board members in advance, provisions must be made for situations in which a person joins the Executive Board or is promoted after the remuneration has been approved. An additional amount, not exceeding 50% of the last approved budget approved is available to fund such cases, as provided for under the ORAb/VegüV. The Company did not use the services of external consultants when setting any of this remuneration.\n\n\n## TAKEOVERS AND DEFENSIVE MEASURES\n\nThe Articles of Association do not contain any 'opting out' or 'opting up' clauses. The employment contracts of operational members of the Executive Board, like those of senior executives of the Group, do not generally contain any specific provision with respect to a change in control of Compagnie Financière Tradition SA, with the exception of the employment contracts of two Executive Board members. These contracts contain a clause providing for the executives to retain office under identical employment conditions for the duration of their contracts in the event of a change in control of the Company, and, for one of them, a right to early termination of the contract upon three months' notice and an indemnity of no more than twelve months' salary.\n\nThe option schemes provide for early exercise in the event of a change in control of the Company, in which case the options can be exercised within nine months of the event.\n\n\n## INFORMATION POLICY\n\nCompagnie Financière Tradition SA releases consolidated revenue figures on a quarterly\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nbasis, and consolidated results on a half-yearly and annual basis.

It is assisted in these tasks by the Audit Committee, whose role is to oversee the internal control of financial reporting, risk management, and compliance with the laws and regulations. The Internal Audit department reviews the effectiveness of risk management procedure and internal controls, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Risk Management department operates independently and reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Directors. It is responsible for identifying, assessing, mapping and monitoring the Group's risk exposure."

        "text": "The Group is exposed to the following types of risk:\n- Compliance risk -\n- Credit and counterparty risk -\n- Operational risk -\n- Liquidity risk -\n- Market risk -\n\n\nThis section details the Group's exposure to each of these risk areas, the methods it uses to measure risk, and the risk management policy and procedures.\n\n\n## COMPLIANCE RISK\n\n\nCompliance risk mainly involves:\n- non-compliance with market abuse -regulatory requirements\n- non-compliance with anti-money -laundering and terrorist financing regulatory requirements, and international sanctions\n- non-compliance with anti-bribery and -corruption regulatory requirements\n- non-compliance with personal data -protection regulatory requirements\n- non-compliance with codes of ethics and -professional obligations\n- non-compliance with environmental, -social and governance (ESG) regulatory requirements\n\n\nThe Group establishes targeted mapping of compliance risks in order to refine its analyses and strengthen the deployed control system to enable it to manage these risks proactively. In addition, Compagnie Financière Tradition SA employees are continually made aware of compliance issues and regulatory changes. Group subsidiaries have set up online training courses, particularly on market rules, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, data security, anti-bribery and corruption, and the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Group monitors compliance risks based on information escalated via quarterly compliance reports submitted by the subsidiaries.\n\nCompagnie Financière Tradition SA has also set in place a whistleblowing system, which enables employees to report serious breaches of the rules governing the conduct of Group activities.\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\n\n## CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCredit and counterparty risk represents the risk of financial loss when a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to\n\nfulfil its obligations. This risk mainly concerns the item 'Trade and other receivables'.\n\nCompagnie Financière Tradition SA is an interdealer broker in the financial and nonfinancial markets, serving a predominantly institutional clientele. This broking business consists of facilitating contact between two counterparties to a trade, and receiving a commission for services rendered. The Group's exposure to credit risk is therefore limited to its own claims in connection with these activities. The quality of counterparties is evaluated locally by subsidiaries in accordance with Group guidelines, and commission receivables are closely monitored. Provisions for impairment losses on receivables are recognised where\n\nnecessary.\n\nSome Group companies act as principal in the\n\nsimultaneous purchase and sale of securities for the account of third parties. These trades are managed through clearing houses on the basis of cash against delivery of securities. The period between the transaction date and the settlement date is usually two days, during which Compagnie Financière Tradition SA is\n\nexposed to counterparty risk.\n\nThis risk is contained within the limits set by the Credit Committee. The Committee bases its decisions on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, taking into account ratings published by recognised bodies (External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI)), and available financial information (stock market prices, credit default swaps, yields in the secondary bond markets, etc.). Where no external rating is available, the Group calculates a rating using based on an internal methodology. In addition to the counterparty's rating, the type of instruments traded and their liquidity are also taken into account for determining the limit. Compliance with set limits is monitored independently by the Group's Risk Management department, or by the risk management departments of the operating regions.\n\nThe limits are reviewed regularly, at set frequencies or following events that could affect the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the\n\n\n## 25\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

It is conducted through Compagnie Financière Tradition SA's indirect subsidiary, Tradition London Clearing Ltd, which is the pivot for the Group's matched principal transactions for Europe and Asia. Tradition London Clearing Ltd. is responsible for following up trades introduced by the Group's operating entities until their final settlement in the clearing houses. Tradition Securities and Derivatives Inc., one of the Group's US subsidiaries, is responsible for settlement of all matched principal operations in the United States.\n\nThis company is a member of the FICC (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation), a central settlement counterparty for US government securities. Membership in the FICC considerably reduces the risk of a counterparty default, since it guarantees settlement of all trades entering its net.\n\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. This risk appears crucial and calls for stringent monitoring. The analysis and assessment of operational risks are segmented in line with Basel Committee recommendations. The Group's Risk Management Department establishes and oversees detailed mapping of risk components, with granularity extending to the three recommended levels of residual risk. The results of this mapping enable the Group to focus on critical or significant risks.\n\nThe monitoring of operational risk at Group level is undertaken through the analysis of key risk indicators escalated by subsidiaries via quarterly reports.\n\nA tool for recording incidents of an operational nature has also been put in place to monitor changes in operational risks and identify the need to adjust internal controls.\n\nPotentially significant incidents include errors in the execution or administrative processing\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nof client orders, and possible malfunctions in IT systems or accounting processes.\n\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nLiquidity risk arises when the Group encounters difficulty in meeting its financial obligations. For risk management purposes the Group separates this risk into two types - transactional liquidity risk and balance sheet liquidity risk. Transactional liquidity risk concerns the Group's ability to meet cash flows related to matched principal trades or the requirements of market counterparties, for instance, the need to fund securities in the process of settlement or to place margin calls or collateral with clearing houses or banks which provide clearing services to the Group. These liquidity demands are hard to anticipate but are normally short term, overnight or even intra-day and are usually met from overdrafts with the clearing entity. In order to manage these risks the Group ensures that its subsidiaries engaged in matched principal trading hold cash or cash equivalents sufficient to meet potential funding requirements using a statistical approach based on historical data, which is stress tested to establish an appropriate level of contingency funding. Balance sheet liquidity risk is the risk that a Group entity will be unable to meet its net working capital needs over a certain period of time due to trading difficulties or significant investments in the business. To manage this risk, the Group's main operating entities prepare rolling twelve-month cash flow forecasts as part of the monthly financial reporting process in order to identify any potential liquidity issues. At the very least, all entities retain sufficient cash or cash equivalents to meet expected net cash outflows for the next three months. Controls are carried out on a timely basis to identify funds which are surplus to local requirements for up-streaming to the Group's holding companies, where working capital or structural cash requirements are identified and addressed. At the holding company level, the Group has set up financing via bond issues and a credit facility (disclosed in Note 20) which strengthens its cash position and its ability to manage liquidity risks."

        "text": "# MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices and affect the Group's net profit or the value of its financial instruments. Market risk includes currency risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group's international presence exposes it to currency risk. This risk arises when subsidiaries conduct transactions in a currency other than their functional currency.\n\nTransactions are conducted mainly in US dollars (USD), sterling (GBP), yen (JPY), euros (EUR) and Swiss francs (CHF).\n\nGroup policy for hedging this risk is not part of a long-term hedging policy. It is dealt with on a timely basis depending on economic trends and conditions, with the exception of the UK which has adopted a systematic approach to hedging the main foreign currencies through forward exchange contracts.\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from the structure of its financial debt. However, since the debt is mostly fixed rate, this risk is very marginal. Financial debt commitments within the Group must be approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE AND INTERNAL AUDIT\n\nThe Risk Management department is responsible for risk analysis, implementing measurement methodologies, and monitoring the risks to which Group companies are exposed. It also centralises compliance risk management activities thus strengthening the compliance function as the second line of defence and ensuring optimised risk management with a stronger focus on compliance.\n\nThe department oversees risk mapping and its implementation in the operating companies. The implementation of controls is supervised in consultation with the internal control and compliance departments and is supported by a large network of advisers.\n\nThe Risk Management department deploys governance in the operating regions by setting\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nup regional risk committees, or appointing regional risk correspondents. Moreover, a Credit Committee, comprised of a representative from the Group's Risk Management department and a risk manager from the operating entity, is responsible for setting counterparty limits for matched principal activities.\n\nThe department assists the operating entities to monitor and manage their risks. It briefs the regional audit committees on the status of risk control operations in the regions, and provides consolidated information to the Group Audit Committee based on a quarterly reporting system in place in all regions.\n\nThe Risk Management department is responsible for the compliance function at Group level. The Internal Audit department is responsible for testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the Group's control environment. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the internal audit and draw on specialised knowledge and expertise, the Group has outsourced the management of auditing missions to one of the Big Four accounting firms. Interaction between this firm and the Group is the responsibility of a Steering Committee, composed of the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Legal Officer and the Head of Compliance and Operational Risk.\n\nThis Committee is attached to the Audit Committee. The internal audit plan focuses on the most significant business risks within the Group's entities. The Steering Committee submits an annual and an multi-year engagement plan to the Audit Committee for approval.\n\nThe conclusions and recommendations contained in this plan are reviewed by the regional audit committees and the Group Audit Committee.\n\nRepresentatives of the firm responsible for the internal audit attend meetings of the regional audit committees and the Group Audit Committee. Their input provides information and clarification that supplements the analysis of the effectiveness and thoroughness of internal controls.\n\nThe Group Finance service, has implemented procedures to ensure the proper functioning of an internal control system for financial reporting.\n\n\n## 27\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

Our continued focus on excellence in serving our client base, comprised of the FICC divisions of all the major investment and commercial banks, hedge funds, large asset managers, and corporates, in their daily trading and hedging activities, also indirectly means better serving economic agents at large.\n\nWe offer hi-touch, hybrid and electronic execution as well as information services. We foster price formation and transactional liquidity across a variety of financial and commodityrelated asset classes, for cash and derivative instruments and transactions ranging from the simplest to the most complex. Our activities contribute to helping our clients navigate imbalances between supply and demand and to manage crisis situations in local or global markets. We constitute a conflict-free and highly efficient venue for our global network of clients to trade, offset positions or transfer risks. We also contribute effectively to the development of active and deep secondary markets, whether in emerging economies or for new instruments.

To support the personal and professional development of its employees and help them enhance their skills, the Group offers training programmes and helps them move between roles - and sometimes between countries because of its international footprint - although most of its teams remain local. Employees see this mobility as a source of opportunity and motivation. Because we operate in a competitive industry, we know that we must continue to attract and retain the best talent. To achieve that, we create a secure working environment, hire a diverse range of people and give a large degree of responsibility to motivated staff members who want to develop both personally and professionally, while also offering ambitious, competitive and fair pay. When staff members are able to give the best of themselves at work, productivity and profits usually improve alongside staff morale and the corporate culture.\n\nWe set clearly defined performance targets as part of the employee appraisal and development process, and ensure that men and women receive equal pay and benefits for equal work.\n\nOur flat organisational structure means that all staff members have direct access to management, and our flexible working hours give them greater freedom in managing their personal and professional responsibilities. We pay particular attention to ensuring highquality dialogue between management and employees.\n\nOur staff members can also move between roles and easily explore opportunities within the Group to develop their careers, acquire new skills and knowledge in other parts of our business, improve our collective understanding of the industry, exchange information and put forward new ideas so that we can work together more effectively. We believe that this makes us more agile and our staff members more motivated, allowing them to see how their work influences the company's success and realise that each of them has a crucial role to play in our ecosystem.\n\nInvesting in the personal and professional development of our staff members is essential to maintain our company's market position and the quality of our services. We are confident\n\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nthat the increasing engagement shown by our people and our low staff turnover rate are directly connected to our efforts to give them greater autonomy. This is why we intend to seize every opportunity to foster a form of socially aware and future-facing organisational sustainability, in order to maximise benefits for all stakeholders.\n\nWe monitor and analyse our staff turnover rate as an indicator of how well the Group is able to retain talent.\n\n\n## PROUD TO FOSTER AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE\n\nWith a worldwide network of offices spanning more than 30 countries, diversity and inclusion are embedded in the Group's culture. We recognise that harnessing the potential of a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Tradition is committed to promoting equality and diversity by fostering a culture based on cohesion and integration. We recognise that employees from different backgrounds and experiences can bring valuable knowledge to the work environment. Group entities aim to recruit and retain a diverse workforce that reflects the global markets in which we operate. The brokerage profession has historically been a male-dominated workplace. However, the Group supports women in leadership roles and we are pursuing our commitment to ensure equal opportunities for both women and men. At the same time, we are pursuing our global policy of preventing all forms of discrimination in the workplace.\n\nNo job applicant or employee is treated less favourably on the grounds of race, colour, age, nationality, ethnicity or national origin, religion, beliefs, marital status, sex, disability, or any other illegal discrimination criteria or circumstances.

Our direct suppliers overwhelmingly consist of providers of intellectual services that are located in countries with strict employment requirements under local labour laws.

It is aware that companies able to comply strictly with regulations through robust internal controls and to offer services that meet the sector's highest professional standards will be better placed to build trusted relationships with clients, leading to higher revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimising losses from legal proceedings.\n\nThe Group's code of ethics and anti-corruption code of conduct give all employees advice about best practice and the required standards of business conduct. They are supplemented by more detailed group policies, such as those relating to corruption, financial security and conflicts of interest, along with other policies and guidelines at the Group and local levels. The corruption policy provides details of the Group's solid anti-corruption system, which is based on risks identified at the Group level. We pay special attention to potential exposure to public officials, relations with third parties, recruitment, gifts and entertainment, and we take care to ensure compliance in relation to client acquisition, donations and sponsorship,\n\nlobbying and facilitation payments.\n\nThe Group's policy on conflicts of interest contains provisions about how to identify and manage such conflicts. Practical examples and scenarios of conflicts of interest are provided to help employees identify risky situations and respond in a way that is appropriate and consistent with the policy.\n\nThe Group has also set up a whistleblowing system, allowing the employees of subsidiaries to report serious events that are inconsistent with the rules governing the way the Group conducts its business.\n\n\n## 39\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

With the easing of Covid-19 measures, the gradual transition back to the office across the trading floors also benefited our activities, and generally enabled the financial markets to function more efficiently.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Group's adjusted consolidated revenue was up 10.6% at constant exchange rates to CHF 1,028.6m, compared with CHF 950.8m in 2021. Adjusted revenue from interdealer broking business (IDB) grew 10.4% at constant exchange rates to CHF 994.7m, while revenue from the online forex trading business for retail investors in Japan (non-IDB), was ahead 14.6% to CHF  33.9m. At current exchange rates, adjusted consolidated revenue was up 8.2%, while IDB and non-IDB activity was up 8.5% and 0.3% respectively, caused by depreciation of JPY over the year.\n\nAfter an increase of 7.7% at constant exchange rates in the first half, adjusted consolidated revenue was up 13.8% at constant exchange rates in the second half compared to the same period in 2021, with IDB business growing by 13.9% and non-IDB business by 11.9%.\n\nAdjusted operating profit before exceptional items was CHF 130.3m against CHF 99.9m in 2021, an increase of 34.0% at constant exchange rates, with an operating margin of 12.7% and 10.5% respectively. Net exceptional costs represented CHF 12.9m compared with CHF 5.8m in the previous year and include a net amount of CHF 7.9m in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Group is active in all the major financial markets and operates in numerous currencies. Its results are therefore affected by movements in the exchange rates used to translate local figures into Swiss francs.\n\nIn the tables below, changes in activity compared with 2021 are presented at constant exchange rates in order to provide a clearer analysis of underlying performance, as well as at current exchange rates used to prepare the income statement."

In addition to general market monitoring and targeting improvements in areas such as security and swaps based trading, the Russian invasion of Ukraine remained a focal point as U.S. regulators and participants continued to monitor the effects of the conflict on global and domestic financial markets. U.S. regulators sought to ensure that the financial services community was upholding sanctions imposed by the U.S. Government. High-profile failures in the crypto and digital asset marketplace resulted in heightened activity within U.S. government bodies and the wider regulatory community. The meltdown of the crypto exchange FTX, and continued concerns about the stability of this new trading sector, fuelled ongoing debates on all U.S. government and regulatory fronts as to how the digital-asset landscape should evolve from a governance, investment, trading and riskmanagement perspective. New developments, such as ISDA's 'Standard Definitions for Digital Asset Derivatives', were seen as a positive step forward.\n\nCybercrime and climate change remained a constant theme for regulators as they continued to look at how changes within the U.S. domestic market structure could positively affect developments in both of these areas. With both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) focused on the effects of climate change, in 2022, the SEC proposed significant new requirements to enhance and standardise disclosures regarding climate-related risks. Unlike existing climate and ESG disclosure requirements, which have largely been principles-based, the new proposal, while still including materiality thresholds, also includes more prescriptive line-item requirements. These proposed requirements would apply to domestic registrants as well as foreign private issuers. Around the same time, the CFTC announced the creation of the CFTC's multidivisional Climate Risk Unit (CRU) to better understand the role of derivatives in pricing and mitigating climate-related risk. This unit will\n\n\n## Operating Review\n\nalso work to support the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy through market-based initiatives and product innovation. focus on cybersecurity, particularly disclosure requirements to enhance and standardise public company disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management and incident\n\nIn 2022, both agencies committed to increasing reporting.\n\nThe CFTC also focused on four other topics: (i) ongoing transitioning away from LIBOR, (ii) initial margin requirements for uncleared Swaps final phase 6 implemented in September 2022, (iii) data reporting - new reporting requirements were implemented in December 2022, and (iv) decentralised finance (DeFi) and digital assets. The SEC took various steps toward restructuring the regulatory regime for trading over-thecounter (OTC) security-based swaps. Included in their activity, was the proposed new Regulation SE under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) to create a regime for the registration and regulation of securitybased swap execution facilities (SBSEFs). The new regulatory framework was one of the major reforms required under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) relating to the OTC derivatives market, but one which the SEC has taken some time to implement.\n\n\n## EUROPE\n\n\n## UNITED KINGDOM\n\nIn an unprecedented year for UK regulated firms, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took extensive action in advancing a number of regulatory initiatives in 2022. These specifically included four areas of increasing regulatory focus: (i) the UK future regulatory direction of travel; (ii) fintech and crypto assets; (iii) ESG developments; and (iv) the proposed extension of the regulatory regime to non-financial services businesses.\n\nThe final consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework has now closed and the proposed new arrangements would delegate considerable responsibility to the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the FCA.

The JFSA also introduced several documents: (i) the Policy for Strengthening Cyber Security in the Financial Sector, which included enhanced cybersecurity measures for financial institutions, (ii) the Supervisory Guidance on Climate-related Risk Management and Client Engagement, (iii) the Guidelines for Creating, Recordkeeping and Reporting of Transaction Information specified in Article 4(1) of the Cabinet Office Order on the Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives Transactions, etc. Elsewhere, Japan and the JFSA became signatories to the IOSCO Asia-Pacific Regional Committee Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding for Supervisory Cooperation (APRC Supervisory MMoU).

The BOT, SEC, Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) and Office of Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) signed an MoU on Personal Data Protection in the Financial Sector. The BOT also relaxed foreign exchange regulations to support capital movement and flexibility in conducting foreign exchange transactions. The OTC market migrated Interbank Interest Rate Swap referencing to Thai Overnight Repurchase Rate (THOR).\n\n\n## INDONESIA\n\nBank Indonesia (BI) emphasised in 2022 that digital financial inclusion remains a priority agenda in Indonesia. The BI issued a joint statement with the Financial Services Authority (OJK), the Ministry of Finance, and the Indonesia Foreign Exchange Market Committee, highlighting the importance of market participants understanding benchmark rates to ensure market function and financial stability. The BI also signed the Renminbi Liquidity Arrangement with the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) and other central banks from Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chile, and the PRC.\n\n\n## AUSTRALIA\n\nThe Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) introduced new market integrity rules to promote the technological and operational resilience of securities and futures market operators and participants.

It also continued to update and alter guidance on consumer remediation to encourage license-holding organisations to operate more efficiently, honestly and fairly. It released two reports detailing the standards of practice within wholesale financial markets, and announced its enforcement priorities for 2023, which include enforcement action on greenwashing, prosecuting predatory lending, and intervening in investment scams.\n\n\n# NEW ZEALAND\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) finalised the Financial Markets Infrastructure regulatory framework. The FMA published an information sheet on Record Keeping for Financial Advice Providers (FAPs) to help FAPs to demonstrate compliance with their record keeping obligations. A second information sheet on Cyber Security and Operational Systems Resilience was published to assist market services licensees to enhance the resilience of their technology and operational systems and meet any relevant license obligations. In addition, the FMA opened consultation on standard conditions for financial institution licenses.\n\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nThe level of activity at the start of 2023 continued along the lines of last year, growing more than 10% from January to mid-March compared with the same period in 2022 at constant exchange rates, driven by central bank monetary tightening policy to combat stubborn inflation. Compagnie Financière Tradition will pursue its growth strategy and cost discipline, while maintaining investment in its data and analytics activities and hybrid broking capabilities.\n\n\n## Operating Review"

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n\n## 51\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n\n## GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT\n\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nThe Group recognized a goodwill of CHF 31.7 million as at 31 December 2022 arising mainly from the TFS cash-generating units (CHF 18.3 million).\n\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed annually at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs) and relies on estimates of value-inuse based on discounted future cash flows. Projecting and discounting future cash flows requires subjective judgements on the different assumptions used.\n\nDue to the significance of the Group's recognized goodwill and the inherent uncertainty of forecasting and discounting future cash flows, this is deemed to be a significant area of judgment.\n\n\n## For further information on goodwill impairment refer to the following:\n\n\n- Section 'Key accounting estimates and -judgments' (Goodwill impairment) on page 63.\n- Section 'Significant accounting policies' -(intangible assets, impairment losses on non-financial assets) on page 67.\n- Note 8 on pages 83 to 84. -\n\n\n\n## OUR RESPONSE\n\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the methodical and mathematical accuracy of the model used for the impairment tests, the appropriateness of the assumptions used, and the methodology used by management to prepare its cash flow forecast. We used our own valuation specialist to support\n\nour procedures.\n\n\nFor a sample of cash generating units (CGUs), identified based on quantitative and qualitative factors, we performed the following audit procedures:\n- assessing the reasonableness of the plans -and forecasts by back-testing historical forecasts to actual results;\n- challenging the robustness of the key -assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount, including identification of the CGUs, forecast cash flows, long-term growth rates and the discount rates based on our understanding of the commercial prospects of the related assets and by comparing them with publicly available data;\n- conducting sensitivity analyses, taking into -account the historical forecasting accuracy of the Group;\n- recalculating the difference between the -carrying value and the recoverable amount to assess the headroom.\n\n\nWe also considered the appropriateness of disclosures in relation to impairment sensitivities in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## Statutory Auditor's Report"

Such receivables result from the brokerage activity, where Group companies act as principal in the simultaneous purchase and sale of financial instruments for the account of third parties (matched trades).\n\nWhen a trade cannot be settled as part of the normal course of business, a risk of potential value adjustment arises if the receivable is higher than the fair market value of the financial instruments to be delivered. The determination of such value adjustment for deals not settled as part of the normal course of business at year-end is a significant area of judgment.\n\n\n## NOTRE APPROCHE\n\n\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the process used to identify unsettled deals with a risk of impairment at year-end. For a sample of unsettled deals at year-end, we performed the following audit procedures:\n- ensuring subsequent payment collection; -\n- assessing the counterparty risk default during -the subsequent period in order to ensure proper identification of impaired receivables at year-end;\n- performing back-testing on historical -impairment and losses associated with matched principal activities receivables.\n\n\nMoreover, we evaluated the appropriateness of methods applied and verified key data used and assumptions made in determining the significant value adjustments.\n\n\nFor further information on valuation of receivables from deals not settled at yearend (matched principal activities) refer to the following:\n- Section 'Significant accounting policies' -(Matched principal activities) on page 67.\n- Note 1 on pages 73 to 76. -\n- Note 30, paragraphs relating to credit risk -on pages 114 to 116.\n\n\n\n## 53\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material -misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit\n\n\n\n## Statutory Auditor's Report\n\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control -relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting -policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of -the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure -and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence -regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n\n\n## 55\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

With a presence in more than 30 countries, the Compagnie Financière Tradition Group ('the Group') is one of the world's leading interdealer brokers of both financial products (money market products, bonds, interest rate, currency and credit derivatives, equities, equity derivatives, interest rate futures and index futures) and nonfinancial products (energy, precious metals, and environmental products). Its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Third Market Segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Compagnie Financière Tradition SA is indirectly owned by VIEL & Cie, which holds a 71.40% controlling interest. VIEL & CIE is itself held by VIEL et Compagnie-Finance.\n\nPublication of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2022."

        "text": "# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of Swiss francs (CHF) except where expressly stated otherwise; the Swiss franc is Compagnie Financière Tradition SA's functional currency and presentation currency. The consolidated financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n## CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\nThe main accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements are identical to those in effect at 31 December 2021, except for the following standards and amendments which have been applied since 1 January 2022:\n| Standard                                          | Name                                                  | Effective  date   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| IAS 37  (amendments)                              | Onerous Contracts  - - Cost of Fulfilling a  Contract | 1 January  2022   |\n| Annual  Improvements to  IFRSs (2018-2020  Cycle) | Annual  - Improvements to  IFRSs (2018-2020  Cycle)   | 1 January  2022   |\n\n\nThe adoption of these new provisions did not have any material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management makes certain assumptions and estimates in applying its accounting policies. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the Group's activities, certain items in the consolidated financial statements cannot be measured accurately and must therefore be estimated. Estimates involve judgments based on the latest reliable information available. The key estimates and assumptions concerning the future and other important sources of uncertainty regarding estimates at the balance sheet date that present a significant risk of\n\nentailing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The value in use of goodwill is estimated using discounted cash flow projections on the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which the goodwill has been allocated. Future cash flow projections and the discount rate to be used in calculating their present value are based on estimates made by Management. Additional information is disclosed in Note. 8.\n\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Management estimates the deferred tax assets to be recognised on the basis of forecasts of future taxable profits. Additional information is disclosed in Note. 5.\n\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe Group's obligations under defined benefit schemes are measured each year on the basis of actuarial valuations. This type of valuation implies the use of actuarial assumptions the most important of which are the discount rate, future salary and pension increases, and the mortality rate. Because of the long-term perspective, these estimates involve a degree of uncertainty. Additional information is disclosed in Note. 22.\n\n\n## Litigation\n\nProvisions are recognised for ongoing litigation when the probable outcome of a lawsuit or other litigation involving the Group can be reliably estimated. The timing of cash outflows relating to these provisions is uncertain, as it will depend on the outcome of the relevant cases. They have therefore not been discounted as their present value would not be a reliable estimate. Additional information is disclosed in Note. 21.\n\n\n## 63\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

        "text": "# A N N U A L   R E P O R T 64\n\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Compagnie Financière Tradition SA, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates ('the Group'). A list of the main consolidated companies, together with the controlling interest, equity interest, and method of consolidation for each one, is shown in Note 31.\n\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nCompany acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. Acquisition cost is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, in exchange for control of the acquired company. Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed. The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company, which meet the recognition criteria, are recognised at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is initially measured at cost, which is the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities so recognised. If, after remeasurement, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the acquisition, the excess is immediately recognised in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nGoodwill on subsidiaries is shown on the balance sheet under intangible assets. As part of the annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. Its value in use is estimated using discounted cash flow projections. Non-controlling interests in the acquired company are initially measured on the basis of their proportion of the fair value of the net assets acquired.\n\n\n## Consolidation methods\n\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nAll companies in which Compagnie Financière Tradition SA directly or indirectly holds a controlling interest are fully consolidated in\n\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nthe financial statements. There is control when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the company and when it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is obtained until the date on which control ceases. Non-controlling interests in the net assets and the comprehensive income of consolidated subsidiaries are identified and presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income even if this results in a deficit balance for the noncontrolling interests.\n\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a partnership which confers on the Group rights to the net assets of the company in which it exercises joint control with other shareholders. The Group's interests in joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. Goodwill identified on joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates in which Compagnie Financière Tradition SA has a significant but not controlling influence on the financial and operating policies are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is presumed when Compagnie Financière Tradition SA directly or indirectly holds over 20% of the equity voting rights in these companies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the net assets and the profit or loss of associates. Goodwill identified on associates is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n\n## Elimination of intercompany transactions\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements, balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised gains and losses on transactions with associates and jointly controlled companies are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities."

        "text": "# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is the Swiss franc. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity of the Group using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Translation differences resulting from such transactions are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and recognised at their historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Those recognised at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which fair value is determined. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, including goodwill and fair value\n\nadjustments, are translated into Swiss francs at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs at the average exchange rates for the year.\n\nTranslation differences resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between years, applied to the net position of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, and differences between the average exchange rate during the year and the year-end exchange rate applied to the results of subsidiaries, are charged directly to equity, under 'Currency translation'. When a foreign subsidiary is disposed of, the cumulative amount of any exchange differences relating to the subsidiary recognised in equity is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\nThe main exchange rates against the Swiss franc used in consolidation are shown below:\n|                  |     | 2022         | 2022         | 2021         | 2021         |\n|------------------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                  |     | Closing rate | Average rate | Closing rate | Average rate |\n| 1 euro           | EUR | 0.98         | 1.01         | 1.03         | 1.08         |\n| 1 pound sterling | GBP | 1.11         | 1.18         | 1.23         | 1.25         |\n| 100 Japanese yen | JPY | 0.70         | 0.73         | 0.79         | 0.83         |\n| 1 US dollar      | USD | 0.92         | 0.95         | 0.91         | 0.91         |\n\n\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue consists of broking revenues and commissions from broking activities conducted by Compagnie Financière Tradition's operating subsidiaries with third parties. For transactions in which we act as agents, revenue is presented net of rebates, discounts, and charges paid to correspondents, and is recognised at the time of the transaction. With matched principal activities, where the Group acts as principal to simultaneously buy and sell securities for the account of third parties, commission revenues represent the difference between the buying and selling price of the securities, and are recognised at the delivery date.\n\n\n## Net financial result\n\nThe net financial result includes interest from reinvestment of short-term cash flows, interest\n\npaid on short- and long-term financial debts and lease liabilities, interest in respect of account holder activities, as well as gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities. This item also includes exchange rate gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities. Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement pro rata over the relevant period using the effective interest method.\n\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe tax expense in the income statement includes current and deferred income tax, tax adjustments from previous years, and any interest and penalties. The tax effect of items recognised directly in consolidated equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in consolidated equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n\n## 65\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Any change in tax rate is recognised in the income statement except when it relates directly to equity items, or in other comprehensive income.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, excepting those related to initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards when it is probable that taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Otherwise, they are only recognised to the extent of the deferred tax liabilities for the same taxable entity.\n\n\n## Property and equipment\n\n\nItems of property and equipment are stated on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:\n- Fixtures and fittings: -5 to 10 years.\n- Computing and telephone equipment: -2 to 5 years.\n- Other property and equipment: -3 to 5 years.\n\n\nWhen elements of the same tangible asset have a different estimated useful life, they are recognised separately under property and equipment and depreciated over their respective estimated useful life.\n\nMaintenance and repair expenses are charged to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred. Expenses incurred for increasing future economic benefits related to property and equipment are capitalised and depreciated. The fair value of property and equipment\n\nrecognised following a business combination, is determined on the basis of market data. The market value is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset under normal competitive market conditions between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.\n\n\n## Leases - the Group as lessee\n\nThe Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of execution of the contract. A contract is or contains a lease if it confers the right to control the use of a particular asset for a certain period of time in return for consideration. When a contract is or contains a lease, the Group accounts for each lease component in the contract as a lease, separately from non-lease components. At the inception of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, except in the case of short-term leases. Lease payments associated with those leases, for which the lease term is twelve months or less, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nThe lease liability initially corresponds to the present value of lease payments that have not been paid, discounted using the borrowing rate implicit in the lease, or at the incremental borrowing rate if the borrowing rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and the exercise price of purchase options if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise them, or any penalties for terminating the lease. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The lease liability is remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in the index or rate used to determine those payments, there is a change in payments under a residual value guarantee, or there is a change in the assessment of an option to purchase, extend or terminate a lease. When there is a remeasurement of the lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the income statement if the value of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated or amortised over the term of the lease or the useful life of the underlying asset, whichever is shorter. Right-ofuse assets are presented in the balance sheet separately from other assets.\n\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n\nIntangible assets are internally generated or acquired, either separately or in a business combination, and are recognised when they are identifiable and can be reliably measured. Intangible assets are stated on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, except where this is indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite estimated useful life are tested annually for impairment. The estimated useful life of assets is as follows:\n- Software: 3 to 5 years -\n- Other intangible assets: 3 to 5 years -\n- Goodwill: indefinite -\n\n\n\n## Impairment losses on non-financial assets\n\nNon-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. To determine the recoverable amount, the Group uses market data or, where this is unavailable or unreliable, discounted future cash flow techniques.\n\nFor goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated annually, regardless of whether there is an indication of impairment, or more regularly when there are indications of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when the carrying amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit (CGU) is greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its net selling price and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for a cashgenerating unit (CGU) first by reducing the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the CGU or, and then to the other assets in the CGU or pro rata to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses on non-financial assets recognised in previous periods, other than for goodwill, are reviewed annually and reversed where necessary.\n\n\n## Account holder activities\n\nSome Group companies act as account holders, receiving deposits from their customers which in turn they deposit with clearing houses for the settlement of customer trades. Moreover, in connection with their online broking activities in forex trading, some Group companies receive deposits from customers, which in turn they deposit with their clearing banks. Receivables and payables in respect of these activities are carried on the balance sheet under 'Trade and other receivables' or 'Trade and other payables'.\n\n\n## Matched Principal Activities\n\nSome Group companies act as principal in the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities for the account of third parties. Such trades are completed when both sides of the deal are settled, namely once payment is made and the securities are delivered (matched trades). In order to reflect the substance of these transactions, they are recognised at the time of delivery. Counterparty receivables and payables arising on current transactions that have gone beyond the expected settlement date are carried gross on the balance sheet under 'Trade and other receivables' or 'Trade and other payables'. Counterparty receivables and payables for matched principal transactions expected to be settled in the normal course of trading are disclosed in Note 28.\n\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments on a specific and generally marginal basis, mainly to manage foreign currency risks arising during the course of its activities. These instruments mostly consist of forward exchange contracts and currency options.\n\nFinancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value, either at the market price for\n\n\n## 67\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

Changes in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the income statement.\n\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash consists of cash in hand and sight deposits held with banks; cash equivalents are short-term bank deposits and short-term money market investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Short-term money market investments are made up of short-term cash products such as government securities and money market funds. They are carried at fair value. All realised and unrealised profits and losses on these securities are recognised directly in the income statement. Bank overdrafts are included with short-term bank borrowings.\n\nBank overdrafts payable on demand are included in cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.\n\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n\n## Financial assets\n\n\n## · Recognition and initial measurement\n\nOrdinary purchases and sales of financial assets are initially recognised and subsequently derecognised on the transaction date. Receivables are initially measured at their transaction price if they do not contain a significant financial component. Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value; financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\n\n\n## · Classification and subsequent evaluation\n\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost, or at fair value through other comprehensive income, or at fair value through profit or loss, on the basis of both:\n\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n- the entity's business model for managing -financial assets;\n- the contractual cash flow characteristics of -the financial asset.\n- · Financial assets at amortised cost\n\n\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThe amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which it is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash inflows over the expected life of a financial asset to obtain the exact gross carrying amount of the asset. Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method minus impairment losses. These financial assets are presented in current assets, except those with maturities of more than twelve months after the reporting date, which are carried in non-current assets under 'Other financial assets'. In current assets, 'Trade and other receivables' includes broking receivables, as well as receivables related to account holder and matched principal activities. Short-term bank deposits with maturities of more than three months from the acquisition date are measured at amortised cost and presented in the balance sheet under 'Financial assets measured at amortised cost'.\n\n\n- · Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n\nA financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and if the contractual terms of the"

The remaining changes in fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income. On derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n\n- · Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n\nThe Group may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition, to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. Dividends received on these investments are recognised in the income statement. On disposal of these equity instruments, the net cumulative changes in fair value up to the time of disposal are reclassified to retained earnings under equity. The Group elected to irrevocably classify unquoted equity investments in this category (Note 14 A).\n\n\n- · Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\n\nA financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThis category includes derivatives and equity instruments that the Group has not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n\n## ·  Impairment of financial assets\n\nImpairment of a financial asset at amortised cost is calculated using the expected credit loss model.\n\nFor broking receivables, the loss allowance is measured at the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable using a simplified approach. An analysis is carried out based on the ageing of trade receivables, taking into account historical default data and the current and foreseeable situation at the reporting date.\n\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognises an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for the instrument if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\n\nIf there has been no significant increase in credit risk on the financial instrument since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses for that financial instrument.\n\nThe lifetime expected credit losses represent expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit losses represent a portion of lifetime expected credit losses and amount to the expected credit losses from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.\n\nWhen evaluating whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on a financial instrument since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. To make that assessment, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort, such as a change in the credit rating of the financial instrument.\n\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full , without recourse by the Group such as realising collateral held. The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\n\n## 69\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

The cash flows that are considered include cash flows from the sale of collateral held. Measurement of expected credit losses is based on the probability of default, the loss in the event of default, and exposure at the time of default.\n\nThe carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account for credit losses. The Group directly reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when it has no reasonable expectations of recovering all or part of that financial asset.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n\n## · Recognition and initial measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value; financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value minus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of that liability.\n\n\n## · Classification and subsequent evaluation\n\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into two categories:\n- Financial liabilities at fair value through profit -or loss\n- Financial liabilities at amortised cost -\n- · Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities are subsequently measured at fair value. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedging relationships.\n\n\n- · Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\n\nAfter initial recognition, these financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost of a financial liability is adjusted to reflect actual and revised estimated contractual cash flows. The adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.This category includes financial debts, lease obligations, and trade and other payables.\n\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe Group measures the fair value of a financial instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is considered 'active' if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nIf there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The Group applies a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).\n\n\nThe following value hierarchy was used:\n- Level 1 corresponds to quoted prices -(unadjusted) that the Group can access in an active market for an identical instrument.

It includes measurement techniques such as discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters for interest rates, yield curves or exchange rates, dealer quotes for similar instruments and use of comparable arm's length transactions. For example, the fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows. Certain equity instruments are measured on the basis of valuation multiples.\n- Level 3 corresponds to fair values determined -on the basis of a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs (not based on observable market data), such as a financial forecast developed from the company's own data.\n\n\n\n## Other current assets\n\nOther current assets mainly consist of prepayments related to the next financial year.\n\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nAll shares issued are bearer shares and are presented in equity.\n\nTreasury shares are recognised on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost and deducted from consolidated shareholders' equity. On subsequent disposals, gains or losses have no effect on profit or loss but are recognised as an addition to or reduction in share premium reserves.\n\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the\n\namount has been reliably estimated. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is the present value of expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, estimated using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and those risks specific to the liability.\n\n\n## Deferred income\n\nDeferred income comprises income received in advance relating to future financial years.\n\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, depending on the countries in which it is established and the local regulations on retirement benefit schemes. Defined contribution schemes are those in which employees and Group companies pay contributions to an entity authorised to manage pension funds. Payments by Group companies are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are due.\n\nThe present value of the Group's defined benefit obligations is measured each year by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial assumptions used to determine obligations vary according to the\n\ncountry in which the scheme operates. Actuarial gains and losses arise mainly from changes in long-term actuarial assumptions (discount rates, future salary increases, etc.) and the difference between the actuarial assumptions and actual scheme experience.

When options are exercised, new shares are created using conditional capital (Note 19).\n\nThe fair value of options granted is recognised as a staff cost with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is determined at the award date and amortised over the vesting period. The fair value of share options is determined by an independent expert using a valuation method that takes into account the general vesting characteristics and conditions prevailing at that date. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used, which is based on repeated random sampling of variations in the value of the share. Thousands of scenarios of changes in the share value are generated making it possible to estimate statistically the value of the options for each scenario, which is then discounted to estimate their value.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that will be exercised in the near future. The impact of this revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment in equity.\n\nAt each exercise of share options, the value of the instruments is transferred from the share options reserve to the share premium account.\n\n\n## Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets and liabilities arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n\n## Events after the balance sheet date\n\nEvents after the balance sheet date are events that occur between the reporting date and the approval date of the financial statements. The value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect events after the balance sheet date that help confirm situations that existed at the reporting date. Events after the balance sheet date that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements where material.\n\n\n## New standards and interpretations\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published a number of standards and amendments which will take effect within the Group after the balance sheet date. These were not early adopted for the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2022.\n\n\n| Standard             | Name                                                                                | Effective date   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| IFRS 17              | - Insurance contracts                                                               | 1 January 2023   |\n| IFRS 17 (amendments) | - Insurance contracts                                                               | 1 January 2023   |\n| IAS 8 (amendments)   | - Definition of Accounting Estimates                                                | 1 January 2023   |\n| IAS 1 (amendments)   | - Disclosure of Accounting Policies                                                 | 1 January 2023   |\n| IAS 12 (amendments)  | - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a  Single Transaction | 1 January 2023   |\n| IAS 1 (amendments)   | - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current                           | 1 January 2024   |\n| IAS 1 (amendments)   | - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants                                            | 1 January 2024   |\n| IFRS 16 (amendments) | - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                                           | 1 January 2024   |\n\n\nThe Group does not expect the initial application of the above Standards and Amendments to have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements."

OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nThe presentation of the Group's operating segments reflects information provided internally to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. He analyses the management reports in order to assess performances and allocate resources to the various operating segments.\n\nThe Group's internal organisation and management structure is based on a geographical approach. Management information is grouped into three geographic regions - Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific - and comprises broadly similar products and services. The geographical approach is based mainly on the location of the Group's offices and operating teams.\n\nSegment performance is assessed and resource allocation is decided on the basis of an evaluation of the operating results, which differ in certain respects from the operating result presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nThe accounting policies applied in evaluating the segment operating results are identical to those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n- Segment reporting on joint ventures includes the Group's share in the assets, liabilities, revenue -and results of these companies.\n- Revenue from matched principal activities is recognised at the transaction date instead of the -delivery date of securities.\n- Interest expense recognised on lease liabilities is presented under rental expense and -recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n\nCertain operating expenses related to the Group's holding companies are presented separately from the operating segments. Moreover, some items considered exceptional, such as gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries or associates, depreciation of property and equipment, or restructuring charges, are not included in operating segment results.\n\nRevenues generated by operating segments are derived from three major products groups, which present broadly similar profitability profiles or transaction methods. All Compagnie Financière Tradition's historical broking activities, in the money markets, spot and forward forex trading, interest rate derivatives and currency options, are grouped under 'Currencies and interest rates'. 'Securities and security derivatives' include interest rate futures operations, sovereign and corporate bond trading, equities and equity derivatives trading in OTC and regulated markets, repo transactions, and credit derivatives broking. Finally, 'Commodities and other activities' comprises broking activities in energy, precious metals and environmental products, as well as activities catering to retail customers via specialised forex trading platforms in Asia.\n\nRevenue only includes income from transactions with external customers. No transactions between operating segments impact revenue.\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is the higher of its net selling price and its value in use.\n\nThe value in use of the cash generating units to which Goodwill has been allocated, was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. The normalised cash flow was discounted to determine the value in use of the underlying activity compared with the carrying amount of the CGU, based on 5-year operating forecasts. The discount rates for measuring these valuations varied between 8.5% and 10.7% (2021: 6.5% and 8.8%) and included a market risk premium to reflect the risk in each of the markets and also an additional risk premium to reflect the additional risk for the size of the cash generating units.\n\nIn addition, growth rates of 2.0% to 5.0% (2021: 0.0% to 1.0%) were used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by operating forecasts based on past experience, in line with the market in which these companies operate.\n\n\nThe different assumptions used for discounting future cash flows of the main CGUs are as follows:\n| In%                                | Discount rate   | Discount rate   | Growth rate   | Growth rate   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                    | 2022            | 2021            | 2022          | 2021          |\n| TFS Americas                       | 9.8%            | 6.5%            | 2.0%          | 1.0%          |\n| TFS Asia-Pacific                   | 9.8%            | 6.5%            | 2.0%          | 1.0%          |\n| TFS Europe, Middle East and Africa | 9.7%            | 6.5%            | 2.0%          | 1.0%          |\n| Other                              | 8.5% - 10.7%    | 6.5% - 8.8%     | 2.0% - 5.0%   | 0.0% - 1.0%   |\n\n\nThe valuations obtained using this method were greater than the carrying amounts and therefore no goodwill impairment was recognised in 2022 and 2021."

Details of these liabilities are disclosed in Note 22.\n\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn the course of their business activities, the Group's subsidiaries may become involved in litigation with former employees over termination of their employment contracts, or with competitors over the hiring of new employees. Subsidiaries may be subject to administrative procedures brought by local regulators. The timing of cash outflows relating to these provisions is uncertain, as it will depend on the outcome of the relevant cases which can last several years.\n\nA Group subsidiary in the United Kingdom is a defendant in civil proceedings brought at the end of 2017 by five English companies in liquidation as well as the liquidators of these companies. In\n\n2009, these companies negotiated EU quotas, also called carbon credits, and did not pay the VAT invoiced to counterparties in the context of these transactions. The Group subsidiary acted as an intermediary in the transmission of a limited number of orders relating to these transactions. The liquidators are claiming damages because they believe that by being involved in the transactions the subsidiary contributed to the managers of the English companies in liquidation failing to fulfill their legal obligations.\n\nThe subsidiary vigorously defended itself and was successful in dismissing all the claims by three of the companies and some of the claims by the other two companies. Certain matters were then referred to the English Court of Appeal where the subsidiary secured further successes. One issue remains in respect of which permission is sought to appeal to the Supreme Court. A provision has been booked to cover for a potential adverse decision in respect of the remaining issue. The provisioned amount is included in the heading of short-term provisions as of 31 December 2022.\n\n\n## 22. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nThe retirement benefits of most Compagnie Financière Tradition employees are insured under defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. Any amounts payable at the end of the period are presented under 'Trade and other payables'.\n\nDefined benefit schemes are confined mainly to Group employees based in Switzerland. Swiss based employees are insured with the employer's occupational benefits institution for retirement, death and disability cover. This occupational benefits institution is established as a foundation. It manages retirement risk itself while reinsuring death and disability risks with an insurance company. Retirement benefits are defined on the basis of the individual's retirement savings account balance (retirement savings capital) at the retirement date. The annual retirement pension is calculated by multiplying the retirement savings capital at the retirement date by the conversion rate defined in the foundation's pension plan rules. Employees may opt to take early retirement from age 58, in which case the conversion rate is reduced proportionally, to take account of the expected increase in the duration of pension payments and the lower retirement savings capital. Employees also have the option of taking all or part of their retirement pension as a lump sum.\n\nThe employer's ordinary contributions are expressed as a percentage of the pensionable salary (according to age) and are paid into the individual retirement accounts.\n\nThe investment policy of the occupational benefits institution aims at achieving a target return which, combined with contributions paid to the foundation, is sufficient to maintain reasonable control over the pension scheme's funding risks. The Pension Board, with the assistance of investment advisers, determines the asset class weightings and target allocations, which are reviewed periodically. The actual asset allocation is determined by a series of economic and market conditions and takes account of the specific risks of the asset classes."

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Group is exposed to three main types of financial risk\n\n\n- credit and counterparty risk -\n- liquidity risk -\n- market risk -\n\n\nThis note presents details of the Group's exposure to each of these risk areas, its risk management objectives, policy and procedures, and the methods it uses to measure the risks. No changes were made in the Group's approach to managing risks in 2022.\n\nThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for defining the Group's risk appetite, establishing risk, management policies and overseeing the Executive Board. It is assisted in these tasks by the Audit Committee, whose role is to oversee the internal control of financial reporting, risk management, and compliance with the laws and regulations. The Internal Audit department reviews the effectiveness of risk management procedure and internal controls, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Risk Management department operates independently and reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Directors. It is responsible for identifying, assessing, mapping and monitoring the Group's risk exposure.\n\n\n## Credit and counterparty risk\n\nCredit and counterparty risk represents the risk of financial loss when a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to fulfil its obligations. This risk mainly concerns the item 'Trade and other receivables'.\n\nCompagnie Financière Tradition SA is an interdealer broker in the financial and non-financial markets, serving a predominantly institutional clientele. This broking business consists of facilitating contact between two counterparties to a trade, and receiving a commission for services rendered. The Group's exposure to credit risk is therefore limited to its own claims in connection with these activities. The quality of counterparties is evaluated locally by subsidiaries in accordance with Group guidelines, and commission receivables are closely monitored. Provisions for impairment losses on receivables are recognised where necessary.\n\nSome Group companies act as principal in the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities for the account of third parties. These trades are managed through clearing houses on the basis of cash against delivery of securities. The period between the transaction date and the settlement date is usually two days, during which Compagnie Financière Tradition SA is exposed to counterparty risk.\n\nThis risk is contained within the limits set by the Credit Committee. The Committee bases its decisions on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, taking into account ratings published"

        "text": "# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nby recognised bodies (External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI)), and available financial information (stock market prices, credit default swaps, yields in the secondary bond markets, etc.). Where no external rating is available, the Group calculates a rating using based on an internal methodology. In addition to the counterparty's rating, the type of instruments traded and their liquidity are also taken into account for determining the limit.\n\nCompliance with set limits is monitored independently by the Group's Risk Management department, or by the risk management departments of the operating regions. The limits are reviewed regularly, at set frequencies or following events that could affect the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the environment in which it operates (country, type of sector, etc.). Exposure is mainly concentrated in regulated financial institutions, the majority of which have investment grade ratings.\n\nThe clearing itself is handled by specialised teams. It is conducted through Compagnie Financière Tradition SA's indirect subsidiary, Tradition London Clearing Ltd, which is the pivot for the Group's matched principal transactions for Europe and Asia. Tradition London Clearing Ltd. is responsible for following up trades introduced by the Group's operating entities until their final settlement in the clearing houses. Tradition Securities and Derivatives Inc., one of the Group's US subsidiaries, is responsible for settlement of all matched principal operations in the United States. This company is a member of the FICC (Fixed Income Clearing Corporation), a central settlement counterparty for US government securities. Membership in the FICC considerably reduces the risk of a counterparty default, since it guarantees settlement of all trades entering its net.\n\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises when the Group encounters difficulty in meeting its financial obligations. For risk management purposes the Group separates this risk into two types - transactional liquidity risk and balance sheet liquidity risk.\n\nTransactional liquidity risk concerns the Group's ability to meet cash flows related to matched principal trades or the requirements of market counterparties, for instance, the need to fund securities in the process of settlement or to place margin calls or collateral with clearing houses or banks which provide clearing services to the Group. These liquidity demands are hard to anticipate but are normally short term, overnight or even intra-day and are usually met from overdrafts with the clearing entity. In order to manage these risks the Group ensures that its subsidiaries engaged in matched principal trading hold cash or cash equivalents sufficient to meet potential funding requirements using a statistical approach based on historical data, which is stress tested to establish an appropriate level of contingency funding.\n\nBalance sheet liquidity risk is the risk that a Group entity will be unable to meet its net working capital needs over a certain period of time due to trading difficulties or significant investments in the business. To manage this risk, the Group's main operating entities prepare rolling twelve-month cash flow forecasts as part of the monthly financial reporting process in order to identify any potential liquidity issues.\n\nAt the very least, all entities retain sufficient cash or cash equivalents to meet expected net cash outflows for the next three months.\n\nControls are carried out on a timely basis to identify funds which are surplus to local requirements for up-streaming to the Group's holding companies, where working capital or structural cash requirements are identified and addressed. At the holding company level, the Group has set up financing via bond issues and a credit facility (disclosed in Note 20) which strengthens its cash position and its ability to manage liquidity risks.\n\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices and affect the Group's net profit or the value of its financial instruments. Market risk includes currency risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group's international presence exposes it to currency risk. This risk arises when subsidiaries conduct transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. Transactions are\n\n\n## 113\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

Group policy for hedging this risk is not part of a long-term hedging policy. It is dealt with on a timely basis depending on economic trends and conditions, with the exception of the UK which has adopted a systematic approach to hedging the main foreign currencies through forward exchange contracts.\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from the structure of its financial debt. However, since the debt is mostly fixed rate, this risk is very marginal. Financial debt commitments within the Group must be approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe Group's capital management strategy aims to maintain sufficient equity to ensure operating continuity and produce a return on investment for shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors monitors return on equity, which is defined as the ratio of net operating income to shareholders' equity, net of the share of non-controlling interests. The Board also monitors dividends paid to shareholders.\n\nThe Group manages the capital structure and adjusts it in response to changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. No changes were made in the Group's approach to managing capital in 2022. Compagnie Financière Tradition SA is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. However, on the local level, the main Group subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements imposed by regulators in the countries concerned. Monitoring and compliance with regulatory directives are the responsibility of local compliance officers. Subsidiaries operate in compliance with the regulatory requirements as defined by local regulators.\n\n\n## 30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\n\n## Exposure to credit risk\n\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk. The following table presents the Group's exposure to credit risk at 31 December:\n| CHF 000                               | 2022    | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------|\n| Loans and receivables                 | 343,754 | 780,948   |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost    | 25,838  | 84,817    |\n| Derivative financial instruments      | 501     | 409       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | 308,269 | 306,176   |\n| Unavailable cash and cash equivalents | 31,561  | 33,071    |\n| Total                                 | 709,923 | 1,205,421 |\n\n\nDue to its broad geographical footprint and the number of counterparties, the Group is not exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk on financial assets.\n\nMore than 90% of the Group's counterparty exposure consisted of investment grade counterparties (rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher) at 31 December 2022 and 2021."

An analysis is carried out by Group companies based on the ageing of trade receivables, taking into account historical default data and the current and foreseeable situation at the balance sheet date. Most customers are major financial institutions with good credit ratings. However, at 31 December 2022, a provision of approximately CHF 425,000 was booked for brokerage receivables in connection with sanctioned Russian counterparties.\n\n\nAn analysis of ageing of receivables related to matched principal activities and expected credit losses is shown below:\n|                              | 2022         | 2022                     | 2022      | 2021         | 2021                     | 2021      |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| CHF 000                      | Gross  value | Expected  credit  losses | Net value | Gross  value | Expected  credit  losses | Net value |\n| Overdue by less than 5 days  | 64,791       | -                        | 64,791    | 214,000      | -                        | 214,000   |\n| Overdue by 6 to 15 days      | 35,054       | -                        | 35,054    | 163,614      | -                        | 163,614   |\n| Overdue by 16 to 30 days     | 2,172        | -                        | 2,172     | 68,468       | -                        | 68,468    |\n| Overdue by 31 to 45 days     | 382          | -                        | 382       | 1,801        | -                        | 1,801     |\n| Overdue by more than 45 days | 23,196       | -16,478                  | 6,718     | 2,405        | -                        | 2,405     |\n| Total                        | 125,595      | -16,478                  | 109,117   | 450,288      | -                        | 450,288   |\n\n\nThese amounts represent transactions that remain unsettled after the contractual delivery dates and are caused mainly from counterparty delays in the settlement of securities. Based on analyses of historical loss data, the Group believes that no impairment of matched principal receivables is necessary. Most counterparties are major financial institutions with good credit ratings. Transactions are subject to appropriate credit limits, established on the basis of the creditworthiness of the counterparty.\n\nHowever, the various sanctions and counter-sanctions taken in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 have made the standard settlement process significantly more complex and have negatively impacted the Group's technical ability to complete a number of transactions in rouble-denominated bonds. As a result, certain counterparties and particularly\n\n\n## 115\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

The probability of default has therefore been estimated at 100% for those trades where the Group has received the underlying securities against payment but is currently unable to settle the trades. Receivables related to these unsettled transactions amounted to CHF 16,478,000 at 31 December.\n\nIn the event of a counterparty default, the cash flows that the Group expects to receive include receipts from the sale of the underlying securities and/or the cash flows associated with the securities themselves. In these transactions, the securities to be delivered consist of Russian government bonds that are listed locally on an active market. At 31 December 2022, the market value of these securities, which were received but not delivered, was higher than the balance sheet value of the receivables. However, in view of the existing transfer restrictions and the uncertain access to the local market, both for the sale of the securities and the receipt of the associated cash flows, the Group considers that the securities cannot be valued on the balance sheet at 31 December 2022.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, a provision was recognised in the balance sheet for expected credit losses of CHF 16,478,000 on receivables related to unsettled matched principal trades.\n\n\nMovements in the provision for expected credit losses is shown below:\n| At 31 December 2022   |                                         |                                                      |         |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| CHF 000               | Trade receivables and  related accounts | Receivables related to  matched principal activities | Total   |\n| At 1 January 2022     | -630                                    | -                                                    | -630    |\n| Reclassification      | -95                                     | -                                                    | -95     |\n| Recognised            | -985                                    | -17,497                                              | -18,482 |\n| Used                  | 96                                      | -                                                    | 96      |\n| Reversed              | 91                                      | -                                                    | 91      |\n| Currency translation  | 76                                      | 1,019                                                | 1,095   |\n| At 31 December 2022   | -1,447                                  | -16,478                                              | -17,925 |\n\n\nDuring the period, an amount of CHF 17,950,000 was recognised in the income statement for expected credit losses in connection with sanctioned Russian counterparties.

        "text": "# KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\n\n## VALUATION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n\n## VALUATION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nEquity investments amounted to CHF 126.5 million as at 31 December 2022 arising mainly from Tradition Service Holding SA (CHF 105.2 million). Equity investments are valued at a maximum of the acquisition cost less necessary value adjustments, considering the general principle of individual valuation. Annually, management carries out an impairment test of equity investments with indications of possible impairment.\n\nDue to the significance of the equity investments and the inherent uncertainty in determining the value in use, this is deemed to be a significant area of judgment.\n\n\n## OUR RESPONSE\n\nOur procedures included, amongst others, assessing the process used to identify equity investments with indications of possible impairment.\n\n\nFor a sample of such equity investments, we performed the following audit procedures:\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the -valuation methods applied;\n- verifying the underlying data and -assumptions used by management to determine the value in use;\n- comparing the value in use to the carrying -amount;\n- verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the -impairment tests.\n\n\nWe also considered the appropriateness of disclosures in relation to equity investments in the financial statements.\n\n\n## For further information on the valuation of equity investments refer to the following:\n\nNote II.1 to the financial statements. -\n\n\n## OTHER MATTER\n\nThe financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2021 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 16 March 2022.\n\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the standalone financial statements of the Company, the remuneration report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n\n## Statutory Auditor's Report\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T 129"

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n\n## Statutory Auditor's Report\n\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material -misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control -relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting -policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the -Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including"

The audit was limited to the information on remuneration, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies Limited by Shares (Ordonnance contre les rémunérations abusives dans les sociétés anonymes cotées en bourse, ORAb) in the tables marked 'audited' of the Remuneration Report.\n\nIn our opinion, the information on remuneration, loans and advances in the Remuneration Report (pages 148 to 150) complies with Swiss law and Art. 14-16 ORAb.\n\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Remuneration Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n\n## 145\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the Remuneration Report, the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of the Company and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Remuneration Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Remuneration Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Remuneration Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Remuneration Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual remuneration packages.\n\n\n## Statutory Auditor's Report\n\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information on remuneration, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 ORAb is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Remuneration Report.\n\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material -misstatement in the Remuneration Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control -relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting -policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made."
