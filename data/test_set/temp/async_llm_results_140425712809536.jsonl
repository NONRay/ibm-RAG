When options are exercised, new shares are created using conditional capital (Note 19).\nThe fair value of options granted is recognised as a staff cost with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is determined at the award date and amortised over the vesting period. The fair value of share options is determined by an independent expert using a valuation method that takes into account the general vesting characteristics and conditions prevailing at that date. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used, which is based on repeated random sampling of variations in the value of the share. Thousands of scenarios of changes in the share value are generated making it possible to estimate statistically the value of the options for each scenario, which is then discounted to estimate their value.\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that will be exercised in the near future. The impact of this revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment in equity.\nAt each exercise of share options, the value of the instruments is transferred from the share options reserve to the share premium account.\nContingent assets and liabilities\nContingent assets and liabilities arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nEvents after the balance sheet date\nEvents after the balance sheet date are events that occur between the reporting date and the approval date of the financial statements. The value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect events after the balance sheet date that help confirm situations that existed at the reporting date. Events after the balance sheet date that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements where material.\nNew standards and interpretations\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published a number of standards and amendments which will take effect within the Group after the balance sheet date.

On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, including goodwill and fair value\nadjustments, are translated into Swiss francs at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs at the average exchange rates for the year.\nTranslation differences resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between years, applied to the net position of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, and differences between the average exchange rate during the year and the year-end exchange rate applied to the results of subsidiaries, are charged directly to equity, under 'Currency translation'.

The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is the higher of its net selling price and its value in use.\nThe value in use of the cash generating units to which Goodwill has been allocated, was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. The normalised cash flow was discounted to determine the value in use of the underlying activity compared with the carrying amount of the CGU, based on 5-year operating forecasts. The discount rates for measuring these valuations varied between 8.5% and 10.7% (2021: 6.5% and 8.8%) and included a market risk premium to reflect the risk in each of the markets and also an additional risk premium to reflect the additional risk for the size of the cash generating units.\nIn addition, growth rates of 2.0% to 5.0% (2021: 0.0% to 1.0%) were used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by operating forecasts based on past experience, in line with the market in which these companies operate.\nThe different assumptions used for discounting future cash flows of the main CGUs are as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The valuations obtained using this method were greater than the carrying amounts and therefore no goodwill impairment was recognised in 2022 and 2021.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 34}]
