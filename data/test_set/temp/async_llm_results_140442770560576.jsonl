Last year I did so with a sense of optimism for the year ahead and, without doubt, that positivity was well placed.\nOver the last financial year, across the Group's equity components, we have realised c.\u00a3155million from 30 companies, delivering an average return of 3.1x. This is an excellent performance, and when taken together with Mercia's 2021 results, we have realised over \u00a3250million of cash on behalf of individual and Limited Partner ('LP') investors alongside our own balance sheet. This in turn has had positive effects on the NAV of both Mercia Asset Management PLC and our Northern VCTs, as well as profits from performance fees resulting from a number of these investment performance successes.\nDirect investments: portfolio-wide progress, breakout at nDreams\nThe table below lists Mercia's top 20 investments by fair value as at 31 March 2022, including the net cash invested, realisation proceeds, realised gains, fair value movements and the fully diluted equity percentage held.\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"* Trading as Intelligent Positioning\n** Trading as Avid Games\n*** Formerly Soccer Manager Limited, prior to a change in registered name to Invincibles Studio Limited in March 2022\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "c53516c2-5db2-4c9f-8e3a-f46306e4b896", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543275, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n    \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1093, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 1124, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1088}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1088, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 5}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 1}]

The Non-executive Chair and Non-executive Directors are all considered by the Board to be independent of management and not influenced by any relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Notwithstanding this conclusion, Ray Chamberlain is interested in 14.8% of the Company's issued share capital.\nBoard operation\nThe Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval including, inter alia, setting the Group's strategic direction, approving annual budgets, monitoring performance against plan, authorising all material direct investment decisions and all corporate transactions, ensuring effective communication with shareholders and approving changes to Board membership and committees.\nBoard effectiveness\nIn January 2022, Lorraine Young Board Advisory Services ('LYBAS') was appointed to facilitate an external review of the effectiveness of the Board. The appointment was confirmed after a tender exercise and LYBAS has not provided any other services to the Company during the year.\nThe process comprised observation of a Board meeting, a review of Board and committee papers issued during the year, questionnaires completed by the Board relating to competency and experience and confidential one-to-one discussions between LYBAS and members of the Board and Executive Team. LYBAS provided a report which identified what was working well and those areas where there was scope for development. Overall, LYBAS concluded that the Board appears to be performing very well. Matters recommended for development included:\n\u00b7 The Nominations Committee to develop an emergency succession plan\n\u00b7 Diane Seymour-Williams to formally join the Committees\n\u00b7 Complete handover of all matters normally undertaken by the Company Secretary\n\u00b7 Allocate more Board meeting time to risk governance, including risk appetite\nThe report was discussed at a Board meeting in May 2022. In the coming months, the Nominations Committee will recommend to the Board actions to support the development of such areas. LYBAS has been invited to return in a year's time to review progress.\nBoard meetings\nThe Board meets formally a minimum of seven times each year. In addition, the Non-executive Directors communicate directly with the Executive Directors between Board meetings. The Board typically holds a dedicated meeting each year to review strategy.\nDirectors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the committees on which they sit and to devote sufficient time to the Group's affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their comments on papers to be considered at the meeting are discussed in advance with the Chair so that their contribution can be included in the wider Board discussion.\nDuring the year to 31 March 2022 seven Board meetings occurred. Details of attendance at the scheduled Board and committee meetings during the year is as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"1 Attended by invitation\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "bc95f386-00b8-4d07-8134-3ba7b2290f47", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543275, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n    \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1394, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 1425, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1344}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1344, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 50}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 20}]

Shareholders also approved a maiden final dividend of 0.3 pence per share in September 2021.\nGiven the Group's twin sources of profitability and cash inflow, the Group's dividend policy does not need to be anchored to one or other earnings source, hence the Board's intention to grow total dividends year on year.\nThe continuing strong Group performance coupled with its positive future prospects, now enables Mercia's Board to recommend a proposed final dividend of 0.5 pence per share. If approved by shareholders at September 2022's Annual General Meeting ('AGM'), the total dividend for the year will be 0.8 pence per share (2021: 0.4 pence per share).\nMercia Asset Management PLC\n37\nIf approved by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 11 October 2022 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 23 September 2022, with the total dividend payable being \u00a32,201,000 (2021: \u00a31,320,000).\nAdjusted operating profit - alternative performance measure ('APM')\nThe Directors believe that the reporting of adjusted operating profit assists in providing a consistent measure of operating performance and is an important APM of interest to shareholders.\nAdjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit before performance fees net of variable compensation, realised gains on disposal of investments, fair value movements in investments, share-based payments charge, depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets, movement in fair value of deferred consideration and exceptional items. It includes net finance income.\nResults reported on an APM basis are denoted by 1  throughout this review.\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Strategic report\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "a65aa707-ab05-4e81-8ef1-c2097fde288e", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543275, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n    \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1245, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 1276, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1216}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1216, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 29}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 4}]

We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nIn order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole and performance materiality as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Component materiality\nThe audit of the Group and significant components were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity, which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from \u00a338,000 to \u00a33,800,000 (2021: \u00a334,000 to \u00a33,800,000).
