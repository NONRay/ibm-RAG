Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity of the Group using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Translation differences resulting from such transactions are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and recognised at their historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Those recognised at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which fair value is determined. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, including goodwill and fair value\nadjustments, are translated into Swiss francs at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs at the average exchange rates for the year.\nTranslation differences resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between years, applied to the net position of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, and differences between the average exchange rate during the year and the year-end exchange rate applied to the results of subsidiaries, are charged directly to equity, under 'Currency translation'. When a foreign subsidiary is disposed of, the cumulative amount of any exchange differences relating to the subsidiary recognised in equity is recognised in profit or loss.\nThe main exchange rates against the Swiss franc used in consolidation are shown below:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Revenue\nRevenue consists of broking revenues and commissions from broking activities conducted by Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Tradition's operating subsidiaries with third parties.

When options are exercised, new shares are created using conditional capital (Note 19).\nThe fair value of options granted is recognised as a staff cost with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is determined at the award date and amortised over the vesting period. The fair value of share options is determined by an independent expert using a valuation method that takes into account the general vesting characteristics and conditions prevailing at that date. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used, which is based on repeated random sampling of variations in the value of the share. Thousands of scenarios of changes in the share value are generated making it possible to estimate statistically the value of the options for each scenario, which is then discounted to estimate their value.\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that will be exercised in the near future. The impact of this revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment in equity.\nAt each exercise of share options, the value of the instruments is transferred from the share options reserve to the share premium account.\nContingent assets and liabilities\nContingent assets and liabilities arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nEvents after the balance sheet date\nEvents after the balance sheet date are events that occur between the reporting date and the approval date of the financial statements. The value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date is adjusted to reflect events after the balance sheet date that help confirm situations that existed at the reporting date. Events after the balance sheet date that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements where material.\nNew standards and interpretations\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published a number of standards and amendments which will take effect within the Group after the balance sheet date.

Group policy for hedging this risk is not part of a long-term hedging policy. It is dealt with on a timely basis depending on economic trends and conditions, with the exception of the UK which has adopted a systematic approach to hedging the main foreign currencies through forward exchange contracts.\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from the structure of its financial debt. However, since the debt is mostly fixed rate, this risk is very marginal. Financial debt commitments within the Group must be approved by the Board of Directors.\nCapital management\nThe Group's capital management strategy aims to maintain sufficient equity to ensure operating continuity and produce a return on investment for shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors monitors return on equity, which is defined as the ratio of net operating income to shareholders' equity, net of the share of non-controlling interests. The Board also monitors dividends paid to shareholders.\nThe Group manages the capital structure and adjusts it in response to changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. No changes were made in the Group's approach to managing capital in 2022. Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Tradition SA is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. However, on the local level, the main Group subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements imposed by regulators in the countries concerned. Monitoring and compliance with regulatory directives are the responsibility of local compliance officers. Subsidiaries operate in compliance with the regulatory requirements as defined by local regulators.\n30.
