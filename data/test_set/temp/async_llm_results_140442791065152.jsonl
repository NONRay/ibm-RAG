In addition, Holley uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business. Holley believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Holley believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results.\nHolley  defines  EBITDA  as  earnings  before  (a)  depreciation,  (b)  amortization  of  intangible  assets,  (c)  interest  expense,  and  (d)  income  tax expense.  Holley  defines  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  EBITDA  plus  (i)  acquisition  and  restructuring  costs,  which  for  2021  includes  a  $17.2  million adjustment  due  to  a  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Simpson  acquisition  contingent  consideration  payable,  (ii)  impairment  of  indefinite-lived intangible assets, (iii) changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, (iv) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability, (v) compensation expense related to equity awards, (vi) product rationalization initiatives aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving stock keeping units, (vii) loss on the early extinguishment of debt (viii) related party acquisition and management fee costs, (ix) notable items that consist primarily of noncash adjustments related to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, \" Leases,\" in 2022, amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions in 2021, and the amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions and a legal settlement in 2020, and (x) other expenses, which for 2022 includes a $1.0 million loss on the sale of a business (see Note 2, \" Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture ,\"  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additional information related to the divestiture) and for all periods includes net losses from disposal of fixed assets and foreign currency transactions. We have  included  within  the  definition  of Adjusted  EBITDA  impairment  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  warrant liabilities,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  earn-out  liability,  and  losses  from  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt,  as  management  believes  such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the performance of the underlying business.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') and may be different  from  non-GAAP financial  measures  used  by  other  companies. These  measures  should  not  be  considered  as  measures  of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing Holley's financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"40\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "efb93be4-3ce5-4216-be3c-151107586ee4", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543275, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n  \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n  \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1596, "completion_tokens": 27, "total_tokens": 1623, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1536}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1536, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 60}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 5}]

Each warrant entitles the  registered  holder  to  purchase  one  share  of  the  Company's  common  stock  at  a  price  of  $11.50  per  share,  subject  to  adjustments, commencing on October 9, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of Empower's initial public offering), provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder. The Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of the Company's common stock. The Warrants expire on July 16, 2026, the date that is five years after the Closing date, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Additionally, the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and are exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nThe Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon 30 days' notice if the closing price of the Company's common  stock  equals  or  exceeds  $18.00  per  share,  subject  to  adjustments,  on  the  trading  day  prior  to  the  date  on  which  notice  of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement and current prospectus in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying  such  Warrants  throughout  the  30-day  redemption  period.  If  the  foregoing  conditions  are  satisfied  and  the  Company  issues  a notice of redemption of the Warrants, the Warrant holder is entitled to exercise his, her or its Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. Any such exercise requires the Warrant holder to pay the exercise price for each Warrant being exercised.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "8bab30a3-844e-4353-b738-559d339f8d46", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543276, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n    \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1410, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 1441, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1408}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1408, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 2}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 32}]

On  December 31, 2022, all PIUs were vested and all compensation expense related to the PIUs has been recognized.\nThe Holley Stockholder's previously granted PIUs included 24,074,944 units that contained certain performance vesting criteria related to the attainment  of  specified  levels  of  return  for  certain  other  investors  in  the  Holley  Stockholder  and  the  occurrence  of  certain  events. Compensation  expense  for  these  performance-based  awards  was  not  previously  recognized,  as  meeting  the  necessary  performance conditions for vesting was not considered probable. The early vesting of these awards was classified as a Type III: Improbable to Probable modification event under ASC Subtopic 718-10, and the fair value of the modified awards was estimated on the modification date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of PIUs is affected by estimates involving inherent uncertainties, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of the equity unit classes, value adjustments for a reduction in marketability, expected unit price volatility over the expected term of the units, unit redemption and cancellation  behaviors,  risk-free  interest  rates  and  expected  dividends. The  fair  value  of  PIUs  was  estimated  on  the  grant  date  with  the following assumptions:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The expected term has been estimated based on the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future unit holder behavior. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero since the Company has never paid dividends and does not have current plans to pay any dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. As the Holley Stockholder is a private company and does not have a trading history for its equity units, the expected price volatility for the equity units is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers. Industry peers, which the Company has designated, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "384dc831-2b25-4b36-be16-940531a7e6e6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543276, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [],\n    \"information_blocks\": []\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1331, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 1362, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 1280}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1280, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 51}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}, {"original_index": 57}]

Upon adoption, the Company elected the following practical expedients related to ASC 842:\n\u00b7 not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases;\n\u00b7 to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases; and\n\u00b7 to apply accounting similar to ASC Topic 840 to leases that meet the definition of short-term leases.\nThe  Company  leases  retail  stores,  manufacturing,  distribution,  engineering,  and  research  and  development  facilities,  office  space, equipment, and automobiles under operating lease agreements.

The  Company  has generally financed its historical needs with operating cash flows, capital contributions and borrowings under its credit facilities. These sources of liquidity  may  be  impacted  by  various  factors,  including  demand  for  Holley's  products,  investments  made  in  acquired  businesses,  plant  and equipment and other capital expenditures, and expenditures on general infrastructure and information technology.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $26.2 million and availability of $113.8 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with $125 million in borrowing capacity. On December 31, 2022, the Company had $10.0 million in borrowings and $1.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of $45 million, which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The amendment also increases the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant level applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 through the fiscal quarter  ending  March  31,  2024  (the  'Covenant  Relief  Period'),  to  initially  7.25:1.00,  and  provides  for  modified  step-down  levels  for  such covenant thereafter.\nThe  Company  is  obligated  under  various  operating  leases  for  facilities,  equipment,  and  automobiles  with  estimated  lease  payments  of approximately  $7.2  million,  including  short-term  leases,  due  in  fiscal  year  2023.  See  Note  14,  \" Lease  Commitments\" in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's lease obligations.\nHolley's  capital  expenditures  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  of  $13.6  million  are  primarily  related  to  ongoing  maintenance  and improvements,  including  investments  related  to  upgrading  and  maintaining  our  information  technology  systems,  tooling  for  new  products, vehicles for product development, and machinery and equipment for operations. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $10 million to $15 million in fiscal year 2023 .\nSee Note 6, \" Debt \" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of our credit facility and the timing of principal maturities. On December 31, 2022, based on the then current weighted average interest rate of 8.4%, expected interest payments associated with outstanding debt totaled approximately $55.7 million for fiscal year 2023.\nAs discussed under 'Business Environment' above, although the future impact of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are highly uncertain,  the  Company  believes  that  its  current  operating  performance,  operating  plan,  cash  position,  and  borrowings  available  under  its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"41\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, {"id": "57c843c7-f455-4e4e-8fa5-1f45b2744a80", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1768543275, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"subject_core_entities_list\": [\"Net cash provided by operating activities\", \"Net cash used in investing activities\", \"Net cash used in financing activities\", \"Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\", \"Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\", \"Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\"],\n    \"relevant_headers_list\": [\"Year Ended December 31, 2022\", \"Year Ended December 31, 2021\"],\n    \"information_blocks\": [\n        {\n            \"subject_core_entity\": \"Net cash provided by operating activities\",\n            \"information_block\": \"This information is from the 'Cash Flows' table, which provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented, with amounts in thousands of dollars.

BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan (the 'Plan') for its employees. The Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Cost Method is used to determine the normal cost of the Plan and estimated pension benefit obligation. During 2002, the Plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits under the Plan. The pension plan assets are managed to maximize total return over the long term while providing sufficient liquidity and current return to satisfy the cash flow requirements of the plan. The plan's day-to-day investment decisions are managed by our outside investment manager; however, overall investment strategies are discussed with our employee benefits committee. Our investment strategy is to weight our portfolio towards large-cap, high-quality, dividend-growing equities that we have historically favored. As our plan matures and interest rates normalize, we expect a greater allocation to fixed-income securities to better align asset and liability market risks. Our fixed-maturity bond portfolio is investment grade. The plan does not engage in derivative transactions.\nOn  January  28,  2022,  the  Company  approved  the  termination  of  its  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  effective  March  31,  2022.  The  final distribution  of  Plan  assets  pursuant  to  the  termination  was  not  made  until  the  plan  termination  satisfied  all  regulatory  requirements  in the fourth quarter of 2022. Plan participants received their accrued benefits from plan assets by electing either lump sum distributions or annuity contracts with a qualifying third-party annuity provider. The resulting settlement effect of the Plan termination was determined based on prevailing market conditions, the lump sum offer participation rate of eligible participants, the actual lump sum distributions, and annuity purchase rates at the date of distribution. As a result, the Plan recognized a final settlement loss of $154.\nThe following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets and the plan's funded status.\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"There was no remaining accumulated benefit obligation for the Plan as of December 31, 2022.
