Our longer-term success is dependent upon growth or stability in digital revenues and retaining and growing our customer base. Key analytics for the year ended December 31, 2022 include:\n\u00b7 Total Revenues - Total Revenues decreased 6.7% year-over-year and amounted to $268.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an improvement from the decrease of 13.8% reported last year.\n\u00b7 Digital revenues - Digital revenues decreased 5.6% year-over-year and amounted to $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an improvement from the decrease of 12.2% reported last year.\n\u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA 1  - Adjusted EBITDA declined to $96.6 million or 36.0% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, relative to $102.0 million or 35.5% of revenues for the same period last year.\n\u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA less CAPEX 1  - Adjusted EBITDA less CAPEX decreased to $91.6 million or 34.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $96.9 million or 33.7% of revenues for the same period last year.\n\u00b7 YP Customer Count 2  - YP's customer count decreased to 92,100 customers for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 104,700 customers for same period last year. The customer count reduction of 12,600 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compares to a decline of 20,700 in the comparable period of the previous year.\n\u00b7 Headcount 3  - Headcount decreased to 629 employees as at December 31, 2022 compared to 651 employees at December 31, 2021.\n1 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA less CAPEX are non-GAAP financial measures and do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures are provided on page 4 of this MD&A.\n2 YP Customer Count is defined as the number of customers advertising through one of our products as at the end of the reporting period on a trailing twelve-month basis excluding 411.ca customers.\n3 The Company defines headcount as total employees including contracted employees but excluding employees on short term and long-term disability leave, and on maternity leave.\n2. Results\nThis section provides an overview of our financial performance in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. We present several metrics to help investors better understand our performance, including certain metrics which are not measures recognized by IFRS.

The adjusted EBITDA margin increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 to 36.0%, compared to 35.5% for the same period last year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022, is the result of revenue pressures as well as ongoing investments in our tele-sales force capacity, partially offset by price increases, the efficiencies from optimization in cost of sales, reductions in other operating costs including reductions in our workforce and associated employee expenses,  the  decrease  in  bad  debt  expense  and  the  decrease  in  cash-settled  stock-based  compensation  expense.  The  decrease  in  cash  settled  stock-based compensation expense results from the revaluations of the cash settled stock-based compensation liabilities at December 31, 2022, resulting in a $1.9 million recovery related to cash settled stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a charge of $4.2 million for the comparative year ended December 31, 2021. The $1.9 million recovery related to cash settled stock-based compensation expense is driven by the refinement of the volatility parameter of the pricing model from using the historical share price volatility of its common shares as a reliable observable input to reflect expected volatility. The charge of $4.2 million in  2021  was  driven  by  the  increase  in  YP's  share  price.

The decrease is mainly due to lower interest due to the full repayment of the Exchangeable debentures on May 31, 2021 and higher interest income as a result of higher cash balances and higher interest rates.\nLoss on early repayment of debt\nYellow Pages Limited recorded a loss on early repayment of debt of $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of a loss of $4.8 million on the early repayment of the Exchangeable debentures and a loss of $3.0 million related to the derecognition of the redemption option of the Exchangeable debentures.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Income Taxes\nThe combined statutory provincial and federal tax rates were 26.42% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 26.40% for the same period in 2021. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including the recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences of $17.8 million.  In  comparison,  the  company  recorded an income  tax  recovery  of  $10.7  million  for the year  ended  December  31, 2021,  including  the recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences of $27.0 million. The Company recorded an income tax expense of 3.55% of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - an income tax recovery of 17.9% these recoveries are non-cash items).\nThe difference between the effective and the statutory rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is mainly due to recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences and the non-deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes.\nNet income\nNet income increased to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $70.6 million for the same period last year due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income taxes from lower recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences. The increase in income before income taxes for the year-ended December 31, 2022 of $16.2 million is explained by lower Adjusted EBITDA, being more than offset by the decrease in financial charges due to lower debt and higher cash balances as well as the decrease in depreciation and amortization and restructuring and other charges. Furthermore, the year-ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by the loss on the early repayment of debt of $7.8 million.\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020\nRevenues\n(In thousands of Canadian dollars, except percentage information)\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 13.8% to $287.6 million, as compared to $333.5 million for the same period in 2020.

These recoveries were non-cash items.\nThe difference between the effective and the statutory rates during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is mainly due to recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences and the non-deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes.\nNet income\nNet income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $29.4 million as compared to net income of $38.7 million for the same period last year. The decrease is mainly attributable to higher recognition of previously unrecognized tax attributes and temporary differences in 2021. Income before taxes increased from $15.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 to $16.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, explained principally by lower Adjusted EBITDA being more than offset by decreases in restructuring and other charges, depreciation and amortization and financial charges.\n3.

Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define debt net of cash (cash net of debt) as Lease obligations including current portion, less cash, as shown in the Company's consolidated statements of financial position.\nAsset-Based Loan\nThe  Company,  through  its  subsidiary  Yellow  Pages  Digital  &  Media  Solutions  Limited,  has  an  asset-based  loan  (ABL)  with  a  term  to  September  2025  and  a  total commitment of $20.0 million. The ABL is being used for general corporate purposes. Through the ABL, the Company has access to the funds in the form of prime rate loans, CDOR (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate) loans or letters of credit. The ABL is subject to a trailing twelve-month fixed charge coverage ratio when there is an event of default or when excess availability is less than 10% of the facility limit. Upon such event, the fixed charge coverage ratio must be a minimum of 1.1 times.\"\"\""}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": {"$defs": {"SerializedInformationBlock": {"description": "A single self-contained information block enriched with comprehensive context", "properties": {"subject_core_entity": {"description": "A primary focus of what this block is about.

The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125  common  shares  (including  388,082  shares  held  in  treasury)  at  a  purchase  price  of  $12.58  per  share  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  for  a  total  of $101.0 million,  including  $1.0 million  of  transaction  costs. The  $101.0  million  cash  outlay  was reduced  by  $4.9  million  for the  cancellation  of  388,082  of  YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan's (the 'Pension Plan') wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (refer to ' Pension Contributions ' section for additional details).\nDividend policy\nOn May 12 th , 2021, the Company's Board modified its dividend policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common shareholders by increasing the dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.15 per share. YP's dividend payout policy and the declaration of dividends on any of the Company's outstanding common shares are subject to the discretion of the Board and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that the dividend payout policy will be maintained or that dividends will be declared. Dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on YP's operations and financial results, subject to the Board's assessment on a quarterly basis, which are, in turn, subject to various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD&A.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share. The dividends were paid on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of 2022 for a total consideration of $14.2 million to common shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.11 per common share on March 15, 2021 and of $0.15 per common share on June 30, September 15 and December 15 of 2021 for a total consideration of $14.7 million to common shareholders.\nOn  February  14,  2023,  the  Board  declared  a  cash  dividend  of  $0.15  per  common  share,  payable  on  March  15,  2023  to  shareholders  of  record  as  at February 24, 2023.

The intangible asset represents costs that will be recovered in future periods, when the related directories revenues, digital products and services revenues are recognized. An asset is capitalized when the following conditions are met:\n\u00b7 Yellow Pages Limited has control over the contract for which the costs were incurred;\n\u00b7 The control results from past events;\n\u00b7 Future economic benefits are expected to flow to Yellow Pages Limited; and\n\u00b7 The asset is identifiable, non-monetary and without physical substance.\nDeferred publication costs are initially measured at cost and are recognized in operating costs upon delivery of the publication or fulfillment of the digital products and services.\n3.8 Deferred commissions\nDeferred commissions paid represent costs to obtain new sales contracts. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a two-year period as this reflects the expected period of benefit. The Company recognizes as an expense, the commissions paid for contract renewals with revenue recognized within one year or less.\n3.9 Property and equipment\nProperty  and  equipment  are  recognized  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses.  The  various  components  of  property  and  equipment  are depreciated separately based on their estimated useful lives and therefore, their depreciation periods are significantly different. The cost of an asset includes the expenses that are directly attributable to its acquisition.\nSubsequent costs are included in the carrying value of the asset or recognized as a separate component, where necessary, if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to Yellow Pages Limited and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed in the year they are incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the capitalized costs, less any residual value over a period corresponding to the useful life of each asset.\nThe estimated useful lives of Property and equipment are as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The residual value, the depreciation method and the useful life of an asset are reviewed at a minimum annually. Property and equipment are tested for impairment when an indication of impairment exists. When the asset's recoverable amount is less than its net carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Where an individual asset does not generate independent cash inflows, Yellow Pages Limited determines the recoverable amount of the cash generating units ('CGUs') or group of CGUs to which the asset belongs.\n3.10 Leases\nAt inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

The Company will examine its lease conditions as well as local market conditions and estimate its recoverability potential for each vacated premise. The determination of the lease cost recovery rate involves significant management estimates based on market availability of similar office space and local market conditions. This significant estimate could affect Yellow Pages Limited's future results if the Company succeeds in subleasing their vacated offices at a higher or lower rate or at different dates than initially anticipated.\nDetermining the discount rate for leases\nIFRS 16 requires the Company to discount the lease payments using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee is required to use its IBR. The Company generally used its IBR rate when recording leases initially, since the implicit rates were not readily available due to information not being available from the lessor regarding the fair value of underlying assets and directs costs incurred by the lessor related to the leased assets. The IBR for each lease was determined on the commencement date of the lease and recalculated at the remeasurement date where applicable.\nUseful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment\nYellow Pages Limited reviews the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets and property and equipment at the end of each reporting period. At the end of the current reporting period, management determined that the useful lives of its intangible assets and property and equipment were adequate.\nEmployee future benefits\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by employing the projected benefit method prorated on service using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Determination of the net benefit costs (recovery) requires assumptions such as the discount rate to measure defined benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets, the projected age of employees upon retirement, the expected rate of future compensation and the expected healthcare cost trend rate. Actual results may differ from results which are estimated based on assumptions.\nIncome taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes evaluating the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of Yellow Pages Limited's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. Yellow Pages Limited's assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of Yellow Pages Limited's ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, Yellow Pages Limited would be required to recognize more or fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would decrease or increase the income tax expense in the period in which this is determined. The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date, remeasured to the extent that probable sufficient taxable profits will be available, or reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company reviews revenues by similar products and services, such as Print and Digital.\nPrint revenues are recognized at a point in time, whereas 99% of digital revenues were recognized over the term of the contract and 1% at a point in time for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"YELLOW PAGES LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n49\"\"\""}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": {"$defs": {"SerializedInformationBlock": {"description": "A single self-contained information block enriched with comprehensive context", "properties": {"subject_core_entity": {"description": "A primary focus of what this block is about.

Financial risk management\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk stems primarily from the potential inability of a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument to meet its contractual obligations. Yellow Pages Limited is exposed  to  credit  risk  with  respect  to  cash,  trade  receivables  from  customers  and  investment  in  subleases.  The  carrying  value  of  financial  assets  represents Yellow Pages Limited's maximum exposure. Credit risk associated with cash is minimized substantially by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties.\nYellow Pages Limited's extension of credit to customers involves judgment. Yellow Pages Limited has established internal controls designed to mitigate credit risk, including a formal credit policy managed by its credit department. New customers, customers increasing their advertising spend by a certain threshold and customers not respecting payment terms are subject to a specific vetting and approval process. Yellow Pages Limited considers that it has limited exposure to concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables from customers due to its large and diverse customer base operating in numerous industries and its geographic diversity. There are no individual customers that account for 10% or more of revenues and there are no trade receivables from any one individual customer that exceeds 10% of the total balance of trade receivables at any point in time during the year.\nBell and TELUS provide Yellow Pages Limited with customer collection services with respect to advertisers who are also their customers. As such, they receive money from customers on behalf of Yellow Pages Limited. Yellow Pages Limited retains the ultimate collection risk on these receivables.\nThe components of trade and other receivables are as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"1 Trade receivables are presented net of allowance for revenue adjustments ('AFRA') and ECL of $13.9 million as at December 31, 2022 ($27.7 million as at December 31, 2021).\n2 Other receivables included a loan receivable associated with a forward contract net of $nil as at December 31, 2022 ($3.1 million as at December 31, 2021).\"\"\""}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": {"$defs": {"SerializedInformationBlock": {"description": "A single self-contained information block enriched with comprehensive context", "properties": {"subject_core_entity": {"description": "A primary focus of what this block is about.

The classification of a financial instrument in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.\nThe fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nCash, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables and certain provisions are not measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position, as their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short-term maturity.\nAsset-Based Loan\nThe Company, through its subsidiary Yellow Pages Digital & Media Solutions Limited, has an ABL with a term to September 2025 and a total commitment of $20.0 million.

The Deficit Reduction Plan includes an intention to make cash payments to the wind-up deficit of $6.0 million every year until 2030. The probability of achieving a wind-up ratio of 100% by 2030 is dependent upon other, uncontrollable factors, including, inter alia, market returns and discount rates. The Board will review the deficit-reduction plan annually.\nIn 2022, pursuant to a statutory arrangement (the 'Arrangement') ( see further details disclosed in Note 18 - Shareholder's capital ), the Company advanced the previously announced voluntary incremental cash contributions to the Pension Plan wind-up deficit by an amount of $24.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, bringing 2022 cash payments to the Pension Plan's wind-up deficit to $30.0 million. The incremental voluntary cash infusion of $24.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 represents advancing the voluntary  $6.0  million  contributions  intended  in  years  2027,  2028,  2029  and  2030  that  were  part  of  the  previously announced Deficit Reduction Plan to increase the probability that the Pension Plan will be fully funded by 2030.\nThe total cash payments for pension and other benefit plans made by Yellow Pages Limited amounted to $36.7 million for 2022 (2021 - $12.8 million). Total cash payments for pension and other benefit plans expected in 2023 amount to approximately $12.5 million.\nYellow Pages Limited's funding policy is to make contributions to its pension plans based on various actuarial cost methods as permitted by pension regulatory bodies. Yellow Pages Limited is responsible to adequately fund the plans. Contributions reflect actuarial assumptions concerning future investment returns, salary projections and future service benefits.\nIn  addition,  Yellow  Pages  Limited  recorded  an  expense  for  provincial,  federal  and  state  pension  plans  of  $2.3  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022 (2021 - $2.2 million).\nAs at December 31, 2022, Yellow Pages Limited had recognized an accumulated balance of $15.2 million, net of income taxes of $3.5 million, in actuarial losses in OCI.\n16.
