For our direct portfolio, IRR is adopted as our proprietary capital is also used for other activities. As at 31 March 2022, the direct portfolio IRR had increased to c.16%, largely following the successful sale of Faradion.\nWe measure 'Total Value to Paid In' ('TVPI') across our Regional and Private Equity ('PE') funds as it shows total value returned and accruing to investors after fees; this naturally increases over time as more capital is returned and the portfolio values grow. Our legacy Venture funds, at a TVPI of 193%, are significantly up year on year as a number of assets were sold at higher values during FY22. Our newest PE fund saw a recovery in asset values as the impact of the pandemic on its portfolio businesses began to recede.\nFor our VCTs, 'total return' includes cumulative dividends paid alongside current asset value to give a true total performance measure. It has been principally flat year on year due to sharp price weakness across the listed part of the VCT portfolios in the final quarter of the financial year.\nOur strong overall investment performance enables us to raise additional funds, and we were allocated a further \u00a331.4million this financial year from additional contributions to the Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund ('NPIF') Equity and Debt funds and our Midlands Engine Investment Fund ('MEIF') Proof of Concept and Early Stage Fund by BBB.

This is an excellent performance, and when taken together with Mercia's 2021 results, we have realised over \u00a3250million of cash on behalf of individual and Limited Partner ('LP') investors alongside our own balance sheet.

Shareholders also approved a maiden final dividend of 0.3 pence per share in September 2021.\nGiven the Group's twin sources of profitability and cash inflow, the Group's dividend policy does not need to be anchored to one or other earnings source, hence the Board's intention to grow total dividends year on year.\nThe continuing strong Group performance coupled with its positive future prospects, now enables Mercia's Board to recommend a proposed final dividend of 0.5 pence per share. If approved by shareholders at September 2022's Annual General Meeting ('AGM'), the total dividend for the year will be 0.8 pence per share (2021: 0.4 pence per share).\nMercia Asset Management PLC\n37\nIf approved by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 11 October 2022 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 23 September 2022, with the total dividend payable being \u00a32,201,000 (2021: \u00a31,320,000).\nAdjusted operating profit - alternative performance measure ('APM')\nThe Directors believe that the reporting of adjusted operating profit assists in providing a consistent measure of operating performance and is an important APM of interest to shareholders.\nAdjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit before performance fees net of variable compensation, realised gains on disposal of investments, fair value movements in investments, share-based payments charge, depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets, movement in fair value of deferred consideration and exceptional items.

The Non-executive Chair and Non-executive Directors are all considered by the Board to be independent of management and not influenced by any relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Notwithstanding this conclusion, Ray Chamberlain is interested in 14.8% of the Company's issued share capital.\nBoard operation\nThe Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval including, inter alia, setting the Group's strategic direction, approving annual budgets, monitoring performance against plan, authorising all material direct investment decisions and all corporate transactions, ensuring effective communication with shareholders and approving changes to Board membership and committees.\nBoard effectiveness\nIn January 2022, Lorraine Young Board Advisory Services ('LYBAS') was appointed to facilitate an external review of the effectiveness of the Board. The appointment was confirmed after a tender exercise and LYBAS has not provided any other services to the Company during the year.\nThe process comprised observation of a Board meeting, a review of Board and committee papers issued during the year, questionnaires completed by the Board relating to competency and experience and confidential one-to-one discussions between LYBAS and members of the Board and Executive Team. LYBAS provided a report which identified what was working well and those areas where there was scope for development. Overall, LYBAS concluded that the Board appears to be performing very well. Matters recommended for development included:\n\u00b7 The Nominations Committee to develop an emergency succession plan\n\u00b7 Diane Seymour-Williams to formally join the Committees\n\u00b7 Complete handover of all matters normally undertaken by the Company Secretary\n\u00b7 Allocate more Board meeting time to risk governance, including risk appetite\nThe report was discussed at a Board meeting in May 2022. In the coming months, the Nominations Committee will recommend to the Board actions to support the development of such areas. LYBAS has been invited to return in a year's time to review progress.\nBoard meetings\nThe Board meets formally a minimum of seven times each year. In addition, the Non-executive Directors communicate directly with the Executive Directors between Board meetings. The Board typically holds a dedicated meeting each year to review strategy.\nDirectors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the committees on which they sit and to devote sufficient time to the Group's affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their comments on papers to be considered at the meeting are discussed in advance with the Chair so that their contribution can be included in the wider Board discussion.\nDuring the year to 31 March 2022 seven Board meetings occurred. Details of attendance at the scheduled Board and committee meetings during the year is as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"1 Attended by invitation\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 20}]

The agreed criteria for determining the ultimate award were:\n1. FuM performance - 30% weighting\n2. Total shareholder return - 45% weighting\n3. ESG progress, high-performing teams and Mercia core values - 25% weighting.\nIn determining the bonus payable for the year to 31 March 2022, the Committee first noted that the Group's financial performance was, for the second year running, achieved without having to apply for any Government-backed financial support, delay any payments to HMRC or suppliers, impose any pay cuts or make any of its valued staff redundant.\nHaving considered the strong financial performance of the Group and the successful leadership of the senior executives against each of the above criteria, the Committee awarded bonuses to each Executive Director at 85% of their base salary for the year to 31 March 2022. Of the total, 50% of each bonus has been paid in cash with the balance of 35% settled in cash, with the net payment receivable by the Executive Directors applied by them in purchasing shares in Mercia, which they will hold for a minimum of one year.\nThe Committee has agreed to a maximum bonus of 100% of base salary depending upon the Group's performance for the year to 31 March 2023, with the bonus award payable in cash up to 50% of base salary and the remainder settled in cash, with the net payment receivable by the Executive Directors applied by them in purchasing shares in Mercia, which will be held for a minimum of one year.\nThe agreed criteria for determining the ultimate award are as per last year, namely:\n1. FuM performance - 30% weighting\n2. Total shareholder return - 45% weighting\n3. ESG progress, high-performing teams and Mercia core values - 25% weighting.\nThe Committee will continue to monitor the affordability and suitability of the Group's remuneration policy and performance criteria and will maintain informal dialogue on this subject with both the Group's Nominated Adviser and remuneration specialists.\nDirectors' service contracts\nThe table below summarises the service contract and letter of appointment details for each Executive and Non-executive Director as at the date of this report:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The following Non-executive Director annual salary bandings, as approved by the full Board, apply for the foreseeable future:\n\u00b7 Chair - \u00a383,000\n\u00b7 Senior Independent Director - \u00a347,500\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 23}]

In the audit of each component, we further applied performance materiality levels of 70% of the component materiality to our testing to ensure that the risk of errors exceeding component materiality was appropriately mitigated.\nReporting threshold\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 30}]
