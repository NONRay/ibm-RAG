An interim dividend of 0.3 pence per share was paid on 31 December 2021 at a cost of \u00a31,320,000 (2021: 0.1 pence per share at a cost of \u00a3440,000). In accordance with the progressive dividend policy adopted by the Board, the Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 0.5 pence per share for the year ended 31 March 2022 (2021: 0.3 pence per share).

The Non-executive Chair and Non-executive Directors are all considered by the Board to be independent of management and not influenced by any relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Notwithstanding this conclusion, Ray Chamberlain is interested in 14.8% of the Company's issued share capital.\nBoard operation\nThe Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval including, inter alia, setting the Group's strategic direction, approving annual budgets, monitoring performance against plan, authorising all material direct investment decisions and all corporate transactions, ensuring effective communication with shareholders and approving changes to Board membership and committees.\nBoard effectiveness\nIn January 2022, Lorraine Young Board Advisory Services ('LYBAS') was appointed to facilitate an external review of the effectiveness of the Board. The appointment was confirmed after a tender exercise and LYBAS has not provided any other services to the Company during the year.\nThe process comprised observation of a Board meeting, a review of Board and committee papers issued during the year, questionnaires completed by the Board relating to competency and experience and confidential one-to-one discussions between LYBAS and members of the Board and Executive Team. LYBAS provided a report which identified what was working well and those areas where there was scope for development. Overall, LYBAS concluded that the Board appears to be performing very well. Matters recommended for development included:\n\u00b7 The Nominations Committee to develop an emergency succession plan\n\u00b7 Diane Seymour-Williams to formally join the Committees\n\u00b7 Complete handover of all matters normally undertaken by the Company Secretary\n\u00b7 Allocate more Board meeting time to risk governance, including risk appetite\nThe report was discussed at a Board meeting in May 2022. In the coming months, the Nominations Committee will recommend to the Board actions to support the development of such areas. LYBAS has been invited to return in a year's time to review progress.\nBoard meetings\nThe Board meets formally a minimum of seven times each year. In addition, the Non-executive Directors communicate directly with the Executive Directors between Board meetings. The Board typically holds a dedicated meeting each year to review strategy.\nDirectors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the committees on which they sit and to devote sufficient time to the Group's affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their comments on papers to be considered at the meeting are discussed in advance with the Chair so that their contribution can be included in the wider Board discussion.\nDuring the year to 31 March 2022 seven Board meetings occurred. Details of attendance at the scheduled Board and committee meetings during the year is as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"1 Attended by invitation\"\"\""}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": {"$defs": {"SerializedInformationBlock": {"description": "A single self-contained information block enriched with comprehensive context", "properties": {"subject_core_entity": {"description": "A primary focus of what this block is about.

The agreed criteria for determining the ultimate award were:\n1. FuM performance - 30% weighting\n2. Total shareholder return - 45% weighting\n3.

We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nIn order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole and performance materiality as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Component materiality\nThe audit of the Group and significant components were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity, which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from \u00a338,000 to \u00a33,800,000 (2021: \u00a334,000 to \u00a33,800,000).

The initial consideration was \u00a316,600,000, with deferred consideration of up to \u00a38,400,000 also being payable, contingent upon certain conditions being met.\nThe deferred consideration comprises \u00a36,300,000 in cash, payable in three equal instalments following the first, second and third anniversaries of completion, provided that no termination notice has been served by any of the Northern VCTs before each respective anniversary payment date, in addition to \u00a32,100,000 payable in new Ordinary Mercia shares on the third anniversary. In December 2020 and December 2021, the first and second cash instalments of \u00a32,100,000 respectively, were paid by the Group.\nHalf of the deferred consideration shares will be payable if the Group has received at least \u00a316,000,000 in fund management fees in respect of the Northern VCT contracts (excluding performance fees) during the three years post completion. The remaining 50% of the deferred consideration shares will be allotted and issued if, during the same three-year period, the Northern VCTs collectively raise at least \u00a360,000,000 in new capital. If either or both of these conditions are met, the number of new Ordinary shares to be issued to satisfy the deferred share consideration will be calculated based on the average of the daily closing mid-market price for an Ordinary Mercia share, for each of the five days immediately preceding the date of issue.\nThe fair value of the deferred consideration is based on a weighted probability of outcomes over the remaining period discounted by 10%. The fair value movement in deferred consideration during the year resulted in a charge to the income statement of \u00a3522,000 (2021: \u00a3365,000).\n23.

A default is defined as the failure to discharge a contractual obligation or commitment into which a counterparty has entered with the Group. The Group is exposed to this risk for various financial instruments; for example, by granting receivables to customers and from placing cash and deposits with banks. The Group's trade receivables are amounts due from the investment FuM, from those investee companies held by its managed funds and from its directly invested portfolio companies. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of trade receivables net of provisions, cash and cash equivalents and short-term liquidity investments as at 31 March, as summarised below:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The Directors consider that all of the above financial assets are of good credit quality.

As at 31 March 2022, an amount of \u00a3318,000 (2021: \u00a3285,000) has been estimated as a loss allowance in accordance with IFRS 9.\nThe credit risk of cash and cash equivalents and short-term liquidity investments held on deposit is limited by the use of reputable UK banks with high-quality external credit ratings and as such is considered negligible.
