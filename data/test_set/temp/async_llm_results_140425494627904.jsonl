These programs are designed to provide funding outside of the Bank's normal market or existing client base and allow the Bank to diversify its wholesale funding resources. This form of funding does not require collateral and generally cannot be redeemed early. Brokered deposits are deposits funded through various broker-dealer relationships. The market for wholesale deposits is well developed. A key feature of this type of funding is that it is generally unsecured and does not require collateral for pledging.\nBorrowing capacity refers to a form of liability-based funding. Repurchase agreements are another source of short-term funding in which a bank agrees to sell a security to a counterparty and repurchase the same or an identical security from the counterparty at a specified future date and price. Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they require collateral.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio, increases in client deposits and wholesale deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a shortterm or long-term basis. The Company believes that its current liquidity and access to such alternative sources of funds will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter.\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $300 million compared to $483 million at December 31, 2021. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $80 million increase in cash provided by operating activities, a $620 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities primarily due to strong loan growth and net cash provided by financing activities of $357 million primarily due to increases in time deposits. During 2022, liquid assets decreased as loan growth outpaced deposit growth. The decrease was partially offset by net cash activity from the Central acquisition of $126 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had the following available funding:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"(1) On-balance sheet liquidity represents funds currently on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Non-maturity deposits have very short contractual lives. The Bank uses historical analysis to develop its decay assumptions, but it looks at aggregate account types rather than individual clients. The review analyzes both non-maturity deposits as a whole and individual deposit categories.\n\u00b7 Perpetual funding is the most stable and least costly source of funding. Its main component is equity capital. It has a zero interest rate and cannot be withdrawn by stockholders because of a rate change. In effect, it is a perpetual source of free funding.\nPeriodic independent evaluations are conducted and documented. Each evaluation consists primarily of: (i) an assessment of internal controls; (ii) an evaluation of data integrity; (iii) the appropriateness of the risk management system; (iv) the reasonableness of validity scenarios; (v) a review of ALCO's charter; and (vi) validation of calculations. In addition, to ensure the model is working as expected a back test of the model is completed at least annually.\nAll of the assumptions used in our analysis are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from the model's simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.\nOn a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models including a static statement of financial condition and dynamic growth statement of financial condition. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a 12-month horizon based upon parallel and nonparallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Nonparallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve.\nOur internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10% for a -200 basis point shift, 15% for a -300 basis point shift, 5% for a -100 basis point shift, 5% for a 100 basis point shift, 10% for a 200 basis point shift, and 15% for a 300 basis point shift.\nThe Company has several instruments that can be used to manage interest rate risk, including: (i) modifying the duration of interestbearing liabilities; (ii) modifying the duration of interest-earning assets, including our investment portfolio; and (iii) entering into on-balance sheet derivatives. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk.\nALCO evaluates interest rate risk using a rate shock method and rate ramp method. In a rate shock analysis, rates change immediately and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate ramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. The following tables summarize the simulated changes in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon using a rate shock and rate ramp method as of the dates indicated:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"(1) The Company decided to exclude the down rate environment from its analysis due to the already low interest rate environment.\n52\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 27}]

All disclosures as of December 31, 2022 are presented in accordance with Topic 326. The Company did not recast comparative financial periods and has presented those disclosures under previously applicable GAAP. The Company used the prospective transition approach for AFS securities for which other-than-temporary-impairment has been recognized prior to January 1, 2022. As a result, the amortized cost basis remains the same before and after the effective date of ASU 2016-13.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 and details how outstanding loan balances have been reclassified because of changes made to the Company's loan segments under CECL:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"In connection with adoption of ASU 2016-13, changes were made to the Company's loan segments to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance under CECL. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio was separated into term loans and lines of credit. In addition, the remaining Paycheck Protection Program ('PPP') loans were consolidated into the commercial and industrial term loan segment due to their declining outstanding balance. The Company also separated the residential and multifamily real estate loan segments.

The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard established a right-of-use ('ROU') model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and lease liability on the statement of financial condition for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.

The Company may obtain additional information to refine the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities and adjust the recorded fair value.\nAccounting for acquired loans\nLoans acquired are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Purchased-credit deteriorated loans ('PCD') are loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination and are recorded at the purchase price. Management determined that any loans which were past due, adversely risk rated, on non-accrual or considered a troubled debt restructured loan were PCD loans. The allowance for credit losses is determined on a collective basis and is allocated to the individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and the allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan.\nNon-PCD loans have not experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The difference between the fair value and outstanding balance of the non-PCD loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the lives of the loan.\nA Day 1 CECL allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans was recorded through provision for credit loss expense within the consolidated statements of operations. At the date of acquisition, of the $388.5 million of loans acquired from Central, $20.5 million, or 5% of Central's loan portfolio, were accounted for as PCD loans.\nThe following table provides a summary of PCD loans purchased as part of the Central acquisition as of the acquisition date:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"Pro forma information\nThe following table presents unaudited pro-forma information as if the acquisition of Central had occurred on January 1, 2021.

A description of the loan risk ratings follows:\nLoan Grades\n\u00b7 Pass (risk rating 1-4) - Considered satisfactory. Includes borrowers that generally maintain good liquidity and financial condition or the credit is currently protected with sales trends remaining flat or declining. Most ratios compare favorably with industry norms and Company policies. Debt is programmed and timely repayment is expected.\n\u00b7 Special Mention (risk rating 5) - Borrowers generally exhibit adverse trends in operations or an imbalanced position in their balance sheet that has not reached a point where repayment is jeopardized. Credits are currently protected but, if left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or in the Company's credit or lien position at a future date. These credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to enough risk to warrant adverse classification.\n\u00b7 Substandard (risk rating 6) - Credits generally exhibit well-defined weakness(es) that jeopardize repayment. Credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. A distinct possibility exists that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Substandard loans include both performing and non-performing loans and are broken out in the table below.\n\u00b7 Doubtful (risk rating 7) - Credits which exhibit weaknesses inherent in a substandard credit with the added characteristic that these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based on existing facts, conditions and values. Because of reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the assets, classification as a loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined.\n\u00b7 Loss (risk rating 8) - Credits which are considered uncollectible or of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.\nThe following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio based on an internal rating category and loan segments:\nAs of December 31, 2022\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"78\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 49}]

The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate is calculated for each loan segment and includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of the expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. For each pool of contractual obligations expected to be funded, the Company uses the reserve rate established for the related loan pools. The $9 million allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures at December 31, 2022 is included in 'interest payable and other liabilities' on the statement of financial condition.\nThe following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:\nLoan commitments - include revolving lines of credit, non-revolving lines of credit, and loans approved that are not yet funded. Risks inherent to revolving lines of credit often are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. The primary risk associated with non-revolving lines of credit is the diversion of funds for other expenditures.\nLetters of credit - are primarily established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and applicant. If the obligation is not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.\nNote 5:   Premises and Equipment\nMajor classifications of premises and equipment, stated at cost, are as follows:\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"The Company recorded $4.7 million, $4.9 million and $4.9 million of depreciation expense during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as a component of other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 6:    Leases\nThe Company's leases primarily include bank branches located in Kansas City, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Texas; Frisco Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company also acquired several additional leased locations in connection with the Central acquisition in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The remaining terms on these branch leases range from less than one year to twenty years with certain options to renew. Renewal terms can extend the lease term between five years and twenty years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in the estimated value of the right of use ('ROU') asset and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recognized one finance lease and the remaining Company leases are classified as operating leases.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 16384, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}, ["{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}", "{'error': {'message': 'Invalid max_tokens value, the valid range of max_tokens is [1, 8192]', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_request_error'}}"], {"original_index": 61}]
