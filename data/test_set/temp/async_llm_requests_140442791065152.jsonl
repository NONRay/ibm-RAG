Comprehensive income (loss) includes the effect of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe table below presents Holley's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"37\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 4}}

In addition, Holley uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business. Holley believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Holley believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results.\nHolley  defines  EBITDA  as  earnings  before  (a)  depreciation,  (b)  amortization  of  intangible  assets,  (c)  interest  expense,  and  (d)  income  tax expense.  Holley  defines  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  EBITDA  plus  (i)  acquisition  and  restructuring  costs,  which  for  2021  includes  a  $17.2  million adjustment  due  to  a  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Simpson  acquisition  contingent  consideration  payable,  (ii)  impairment  of  indefinite-lived intangible assets, (iii) changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, (iv) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability, (v) compensation expense related to equity awards, (vi) product rationalization initiatives aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving stock keeping units, (vii) loss on the early extinguishment of debt (viii) related party acquisition and management fee costs, (ix) notable items that consist primarily of noncash adjustments related to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, \" Leases,\" in 2022, amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions in 2021, and the amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions and a legal settlement in 2020, and (x) other expenses, which for 2022 includes a $1.0 million loss on the sale of a business (see Note 2, \" Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture ,\"  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additional information related to the divestiture) and for all periods includes net losses from disposal of fixed assets and foreign currency transactions. We have  included  within  the  definition  of Adjusted  EBITDA  impairment  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  warrant liabilities,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  earn-out  liability,  and  losses  from  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt,  as  management  believes  such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the performance of the underlying business.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') and may be different  from  non-GAAP financial  measures  used  by  other  companies. These  measures  should  not  be  considered  as  measures  of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing Holley's financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"40\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 5}}

The  Company  has generally financed its historical needs with operating cash flows, capital contributions and borrowings under its credit facilities. These sources of liquidity  may  be  impacted  by  various  factors,  including  demand  for  Holley's  products,  investments  made  in  acquired  businesses,  plant  and equipment and other capital expenditures, and expenditures on general infrastructure and information technology.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $26.2 million and availability of $113.8 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with $125 million in borrowing capacity. On December 31, 2022, the Company had $10.0 million in borrowings and $1.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of $45 million, which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The amendment also increases the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant level applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 through the fiscal quarter  ending  March  31,  2024  (the  'Covenant  Relief  Period'),  to  initially  7.25:1.00,  and  provides  for  modified  step-down  levels  for  such covenant thereafter.\nThe  Company  is  obligated  under  various  operating  leases  for  facilities,  equipment,  and  automobiles  with  estimated  lease  payments  of approximately  $7.2  million,  including  short-term  leases,  due  in  fiscal  year  2023.  See  Note  14,  \" Lease  Commitments\" in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's lease obligations.\nHolley's  capital  expenditures  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  of  $13.6  million  are  primarily  related  to  ongoing  maintenance  and improvements,  including  investments  related  to  upgrading  and  maintaining  our  information  technology  systems,  tooling  for  new  products, vehicles for product development, and machinery and equipment for operations. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $10 million to $15 million in fiscal year 2023 .\nSee Note 6, \" Debt \" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of our credit facility and the timing of principal maturities. On December 31, 2022, based on the then current weighted average interest rate of 8.4%, expected interest payments associated with outstanding debt totaled approximately $55.7 million for fiscal year 2023.\nAs discussed under 'Business Environment' above, although the future impact of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are highly uncertain,  the  Company  believes  that  its  current  operating  performance,  operating  plan,  cash  position,  and  borrowings  available  under  its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"41\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 6}}

As a result of this evaluation, a pre-tax impairment of $2,395 was recognized on certain indefinite-lived tradenames. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and did not identify any indicators of impairment.\nThe  fair  value  of  the  indefinite-lived  tradenames  was  estimated  using  the  relief  from  royalty  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach. Significant judgement is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in performing impairment tests. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived tradenames were the sales projections and longterm earnings growth rates, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The long-term earnings growth rate represents the expected rate at which the brands are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The royalty rate is based on observed market royalty rates for various industrial, consumer and commercial trademarks. The discount rate is based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future sales, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts.\nPotential  changes  in  our  costs  and  operating  structure,  the  implementation  of  synergies,  and  overall  performance  in  the  automotive aftermarket  industry,  could  negatively  impact  our  near-term  cash-flow  projections  and  could  trigger  a  potential  impairment  of  the Company's  goodwill  and  /  or  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets.  In  addition,  failure  to  execute  the  Company's  strategic  plans  as  well  as increases  in  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  could  negatively  impact  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  and  increase  the  risk  of future impairment charges.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 30}}

BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan (the 'Plan') for its employees. The Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Cost Method is used to determine the normal cost of the Plan and estimated pension benefit obligation. During 2002, the Plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits under the Plan. The pension plan assets are managed to maximize total return over the long term while providing sufficient liquidity and current return to satisfy the cash flow requirements of the plan. The plan's day-to-day investment decisions are managed by our outside investment manager; however, overall investment strategies are discussed with our employee benefits committee. Our investment strategy is to weight our portfolio towards large-cap, high-quality, dividend-growing equities that we have historically favored. As our plan matures and interest rates normalize, we expect a greater allocation to fixed-income securities to better align asset and liability market risks. Our fixed-maturity bond portfolio is investment grade. The plan does not engage in derivative transactions.\nOn  January  28,  2022,  the  Company  approved  the  termination  of  its  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  effective  March  31,  2022.  The  final distribution  of  Plan  assets  pursuant  to  the  termination  was  not  made  until  the  plan  termination  satisfied  all  regulatory  requirements  in the fourth quarter of 2022. Plan participants received their accrued benefits from plan assets by electing either lump sum distributions or annuity contracts with a qualifying third-party annuity provider. The resulting settlement effect of the Plan termination was determined based on prevailing market conditions, the lump sum offer participation rate of eligible participants, the actual lump sum distributions, and annuity purchase rates at the date of distribution. As a result, the Plan recognized a final settlement loss of $154.\nThe following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets and the plan's funded status.\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"There was no remaining accumulated benefit obligation for the Plan as of December 31, 2022.

LEASE COMMITMENTS\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases , using the modified retrospective optional transition method provided by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) . The effect of applying this guidance resulted in an increase in noncurrent assets for right-of-use assets of$33,887  and  an  increase  in  liabilities  for  associated  lease  obligations  of  $34,579,  most  of  which  were  classified  as  noncurrent.  The adoption of the standard did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.\nUnder the transition option elected by the Company, ASC Topic 842 is applied only to the most current period and reporting for comparative periods  presented  in  the  financial  statements  continues  to  be  in  accordance  with ASC  Topic  840, Leases ,  including  disclosures.  Upon adoption, the Company elected the following practical expedients related to ASC 842:\n\u00b7 not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases;\n\u00b7 to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases; and\n\u00b7 to apply accounting similar to ASC Topic 840 to leases that meet the definition of short-term leases.\nThe  Company  leases  retail  stores,  manufacturing,  distribution,  engineering,  and  research  and  development  facilities,  office  space, equipment, and automobiles under operating lease agreements. Leases have remaining lease terms of one to 14 years, inclusive of renewal options  that  the  Company  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise.  Taxes,  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses  relating  to  all  leases  are obligations of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes operating lease assets and obligations:\nTable of Contents\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 59}}

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is a party to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business. While the lawsuits and claims against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of the matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company generally warrants its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. These product warranties are provided for specific  periods  of  time  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  product.  The  accrued  product  warranty  costs  are  based  primarily  on  historical experience of actual warranty claims and are recorded at the time of the sale.\nThe following table provides the changes in the Company's accrual for product warranties, which is classified as a component of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\"\"\"\n\nHere is a table in HTML format:\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHere is additional text after the table that might be relevant (or not):\n\"\"\"18.

As an ongoing condition to the Covenant Relief Period, the Company also agreed to (i) a minimum liquidity test, (ii) an  interest  coverage  test,  (iii)  an  anti-cash  hoarding  test  at  any  time  revolving  loans  are  outstanding,  and  (iv)  additional  reporting obligations.\nRefer to Note 6 - Debt for more information regarding the Company's debt and Credit Agreement.\"\"\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "metadata": {"original_index": 67}}
